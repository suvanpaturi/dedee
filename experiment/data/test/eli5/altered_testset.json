The high energy X-rays ionize the electrons, which fly off the material with the excess kinetic energy (KE = hv - binding energy).

By using a French press you use a brewing method called \"full immersion.\" Drip coffee is well, drip coffee. Coffee from a French Press is noticeably slicker than coffee from drip. These oils contains higher levels of coffee flavor and aroma that continue to develop as it brews. It tastes better in your cup at room temperature because the aromas generated by the oil are sticking around long enough for you to smell them. When the coffee is hot, the steam carries away those aromas and it's hard to taste anything other than coffee and hot. As it cools the beans show off their true nature. With bad coffee it tastes like pennies, stale potatoes, and a mangy cat. Fresh coffee will still have those oils and reflect the roasting technique, soul chemistry, species, and drying methodology.

For example, there is a very talented historian at Rice University named Tani Barlow that does a lot of research exploring the depiction of women in Chinese ads in the 20s. It's fascinating work but the majority of her work uses sources that most people at the time would have considered completely irrelevant or uninteresting.

For a 2-D lattice, the Fourier transform of the diffraction pattern gives you a 2-D map of the electron density, which is essentially the locations of the atoms on the lattice.

The divergence theorem says the volume integral of the divergence of a equals the integral of flux across the surface of said volume, so the volume integral of the divergence is also proportional to the contained charge.

Sax started at the lower end with bass saxes, and he then went on to create tenor, alto, soprano, and all other crazy sizes! If you're interested, there's a book called \"Devil's Horn\" (I'm sorry I don't remember the author! ) about the history of the sax and it's place in music. It's fasinating!",

If there is a 50-50 chance as to which team will win, the odds of the Jays winning all 10 is 1 in 1024. This comes from (1/2)^(10). Note, however, as you went into this year already knowing that the Jays won the first 9 games, if you ask what are the odds that the streak would extend from 9 to 10, that is just the odds of single win, which is 1 in 2 (in the approximation I'm using).",

        "response": "Yes, a fever helps in two main ways: First, most things that make us sick, like viruses or bacteria, have adapted to our very specific body temp - ~37C or ~98F. When our body finds something inside us that isn't us, it raised the temperature a bit to make it harder for those germs. Second, a bunch of parts of the immune system work better at slightly higher temperatures. The cells that eat bacteria and viruses, for example, are better at it when the temperature is a just a little higher than our regular body temp.  So when we have an infection, our body raises its temperature a little bit to make life harder for the bugs, and easier for the things that kill them.  & nbsp; It's similar for other symptoms. Mucus in your nose helps catch things so they can't get any further inside. Coughing and sneezing expels bad things. A lot of the unpleasantness of being sick is our own body fighting the germs, rather than caused by the germs themselves, but these things help us get better faster.",
