        "response": "A 400whp RWD car is not any more or less powerful than a 400whp FWD car. That said... RWD is better for acceleration, because weight shifts backwards under acceleration, so shifting to the drive wheels will give them better traction. FWD cars are nose heavy. The ideal balance for handling is 50/50 (imagine a pivot in the center of the car, it would be easier to turn if the weight is equally balanced on both sides, right?), and FWD cars will tend to have a poor weight balance due to the entire drivetrain being located in the front of the car. Further on handling, RWD cars have better balance between understeer and oversteer. When a car is turning, a FWD car will tend to plow forward if you approach/exceed the traction limits, while you can rotate a RWD car with the throttle and keep it on course.",

        "response": "Short answer is as planes got closer to supersonic speeds thanks to the development of jet engines traditional wing designs were innefective since the aerodynamics are quite different under these conditions.  Some WWII planes used elliptical wing planforms since it was the most efficient shape at the time, but also more expensive to make. In most cases they settled for a compromise solution where the shape wasn't quite an ellipse but the performance wasn't much worse and the costs were cheaper. These curvy wingtips probably responded to that attempt of making the wings more ellipse-like without making them much more expensive. But under the new conditions brought by jet engines this was no longer that important, having elliptical wings or very curvy tips didn't help much but it added costs. Also plain rounded wing tips aren't that good at reducing wingtip vortices and better wingtip devices were developed later.",

The divers reflex slows your heart rate, it's activated by jumping into cold water. Another thing they may do is hyperventilating before they jump in [DON'T TRY THIS, IT'S DANGEROUS]. Hyperventilating before let's you lower your level of co^2 which is something your body needs to get rid of when you hold your breath. When you breath your body get's rid of co^2 and takes in oxygen. Your body builds up co^2 quicker than it's need for oxygen. By lowering the levels of co^2 before you jump in you can stay in until your oxygen runs out. Free divers also usually have very large lungs to hold in more air so they can stay underwater for longer. I'm not fully sure how they combat buoyancy but it definitely is a challenge.

If you wake up while in REM sleep or soon after you are more easily able to recall dreams.  Norepinephrine levels - norepinephrine is a neuro chemical that aids in memory, while asleep you typically produce less of it. Perhaps your friends produce more of it in their sleeping state than you do.  Why do we have a tendency to forget dreams? Nobody know for sure but a leading theory suggests that remembering dreams might be a disadvantage causing false memories in your day to day life.

It does seem counter intuitive to mix expectorants and cough suppressants. But cough suppressants don't stop you from cough per say, so much as they decrease the irritation in the throat that leads to chronic coughing during illness.

It would be very surprising if the Nike business as a whole became worth 50% less because of Woods' behaviour. But what can happen is that loads of people who own Nike stock go \"AAAAARGH!\" and panics and hits the sell button. So the response of all those people who got scared by the event causes the drastic fall.

This makes it easier to write complex and dynamic software in Java, but makes C much more low level, allowing the programmer to better interact with the hardware or write more efficient programs (theoretically).  Another example is Java and C#, which are very similar, but developed by different companies, Sun (now Oracle) and Microsoft. Each one has some features that are useful, for example Java is very cross platform (the same program can be run on different platforms such as Windows, Linux and Mac) while C# is less so, but C# has very good GUI capabilities and other features that Java doesn't.",

But after 301 views, YouTube starts checking every single new view that comes in (which is why counters often appear to \"freeze\" at 301), and this takes a little time, so the view counter always has a delay. To count as a view, you do have to watch a certain amount of the video (how much YouTube isn't saying); also, you have to actually start the video yourself. For example, if you click to a non-YouTube webpage and a YouTube video embedded in it automatically starts playing, that doesn't count.

The Persians had more wealth and culture, so they tended to make the Arabs more Persian than the converse. A good example of this is when al-Mansour built Baghdad in the 760s.

When you hear about the speed of light in a medium slowing down, what you are hearing about is the macro level appearance of moving light. The reason it slows down is because as photon move through the medium, they are periodically absorbed and re-emitted by atoms in the substance. This absorption takes time, so the light seems to take longer to move through it. Between atoms though, photons are always moving at c. In my opinion, 'speed of light in a substance' should always instead be called the speed of propagation of light in the substance instead, because they are two different things, and this does tend to confuse new people.
