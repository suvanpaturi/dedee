        "response": "A 400whp RWD car is not any more or less powerful than a 400whp FWD car. That said... RWD is better for acceleration, because weight shifts backwards under acceleration, so shifting to the drive wheels will give them better traction. FWD cars are nose heavy. The ideal balance for handling is 50/50 (imagine a pivot in the center of the car, it would be easier to turn if the weight is equally balanced on both sides, right?), and FWD cars will tend to have a poor weight balance due to the entire drivetrain being located in the front of the car. Further on handling, RWD cars have better balance between understeer and oversteer. When a car is turning, a FWD car will tend to plow forward if you approach/exceed the traction limits, while you can rotate a RWD car with the throttle and keep it on course.",

        "response": "Short answer is as planes got closer to supersonic speeds thanks to the development of jet engines traditional wing designs were innefective since the aerodynamics are quite different under these conditions.  Some WWII planes used elliptical wing planforms since it was the most efficient shape at the time, but also more expensive to make. In most cases they settled for a compromise solution where the shape wasn't quite an ellipse but the performance wasn't much worse and the costs were cheaper. These curvy wingtips probably responded to that attempt of making the wings more ellipse-like without making them much more expensive. But under the new conditions brought by jet engines this was no longer that important, having elliptical wings or very curvy tips didn't help much but it added costs. Also plain rounded wing tips aren't that good at reducing wingtip vortices and better wingtip devices were developed later.",

The divers reflex slows your heart rate, it's activated by jumping into cold water. Another thing they may do is hyperventilating before they jump in [DON'T TRY THIS, IT'S DANGEROUS]. Hyperventilating before let's you lower your level of co^2 which is something your body needs to get rid of when you hold your breath. When you breath your body get's rid of co^2 and takes in oxygen. Your body builds up co^2 quicker than it's need for oxygen. By lowering the levels of co^2 before you jump in you can stay in until your oxygen runs out. Free divers also usually have very large lungs to hold in more air so they can stay underwater for longer. I'm not fully sure how they combat buoyancy but it definitely is a challenge.

If you wake up while in REM sleep or soon after you are more easily able to recall dreams.  Norepinephrine levels - norepinephrine is a neuro chemical that aids in memory, while asleep you typically produce less of it. Perhaps your friends produce more of it in their sleeping state than you do.  Why do we have a tendency to forget dreams? Nobody know for sure but a leading theory suggests that remembering dreams might be a disadvantage causing false memories in your day to day life.

But cough suppressants don't stop you from cough per say, so much as they decrease the irritation in the throat that leads to chronic coughing during illness.

It would be very surprising if the Nike business as a whole became worth 50% less because of Woods' behaviour. But what can happen is that loads of people who own Nike stock go \"AAAAARGH!\" and panics and hits the sell button. So the response of all those people who got scared by the event causes the drastic fall.

Another example is Java and C#, which are very similar, but developed by different companies, Sun (now Oracle) and Microsoft.

But after 301 views, YouTube starts checking every single new view that comes in (which is why counters often appear to \"freeze\" at 301), and this takes a little time, so the view counter always has a delay. To count as a view, you do have to watch a certain amount of the video (how much YouTube isn't saying); also, you have to actually start the video yourself. For example, if you click to a non-YouTube webpage and a YouTube video embedded in it automatically starts playing, that doesn't count.

When you hear about the speed of light in a medium slowing down, what you are hearing about is the macro level appearance of moving light. The reason it slows down is because as photon move through the medium, they are periodically absorbed and re-emitted by atoms in the substance. This absorption takes time, so the light seems to take longer to move through it. Between atoms though, photons are always moving at c. In my opinion, 'speed of light in a substance' should always instead be called the speed of propagation of light in the substance instead, because they are two different things, and this does tend to confuse new people.

If the building is heavily insulated and had powerful heaters and quick cooling, it wouldn't need to be deep at all. If the building had zero insulation, it would have to be very deep. (If you want a number for this case, it can be calculated using the heat transfer coefficient of lunar regolith.) For radiation protection, [it has been shown](_URL_0_) that about [15 to 20 cm of lunar regolith](_URL_1_) is enough to reduce the radiation doses to 22 rem/yr for skin dose equivalent, and 16 rem/yr for organ dose equivalent.

The photoelectric effect is key to a measurement technique called x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), where we can identify the atoms at the very surface of a material by shining an X-ray beam at them. The high energy X-rays ionize the electrons, which fly off the material with the excess kinetic energy (KE = hv - binding energy). We can detect the kinetic energy of the electrons that fly off, which tells us information about the composition (types of atoms) of the surface and how the atoms are bonded together (chemical state).",

By using a French press you use a brewing method called \"full immersion.\" Drip coffee is well, drip coffee. Coffee from a French Press is noticeably slicker than coffee from drip. These oils contains higher levels of coffee flavor and aroma that continue to develop as it brews. It tastes better in your cup at room temperature because the aromas generated by the oil are sticking around long enough for you to smell them. When the coffee is hot, the steam carries away those aromas and it's hard to taste anything other than coffee and hot. As it cools the beans show off their true nature. With bad coffee it tastes like pennies, stale potatoes, and a mangy cat. Fresh coffee will still have those oils and reflect the roasting technique, soul chemistry, species, and drying methodology.

For example, there is a very talented historian at Rice University named Tani Barlow that does a lot of research exploring the depiction of women in Chinese ads in the 20s. It's fascinating work but the majority of her work uses sources that most people at the time would have considered completely irrelevant or uninteresting.

        "response": "The Merovingians adopted Roman hierarchical terminology; for them a 'comes' was a 'companion', someone deriving authority from his mission (either explicit as a palatial count, or implicit as a landed count) from the king. A 'dux', on the other hand, just means 'leader', and while theoretically he should always be subjected to a king of Christendom for his rule to be legitimate, his authority was not directly derived from his association with the king. Things change during the Carolingian period, when the counts become increasingly independent and heriditary. It gets complicated when monks try to capture the subtleties of non-Christian hierarchies within these classically-derived terms, such in pagan Saxony (what are 'satrapes'?) or Denmark 'rex danorum'?",

If you make a dollar, the tax is 10 cents; if you make the full $100, the tax is $10. Now, what happens when you bump your income up to $101. If we did it your way, the tax would be 101 * 20%, or about $20 dollars. That's no good; it's not fair that bumping your income up by one dollar makes you pay ten more in taxes. So we say that instead, that 20% tax rate only applies to income *past the first $100*. That is, the first $100 you make gets the 10% tax, and only that last dollar gets a 20% tax rate.

So say the average home user's connection can handle 20Mbps in total, having a symmetrical connection with 10/10 up/down means that most of the upload speed is going to waste most of the time, because they barely upload anything, but it means their download speeds are slower so it takes longer to download the latest movie/game/whatever.

Multiplication is repeated addition (4×3= 4+4+4) and exponentials are repeated multiplication (4^3 =4×4×4).

Because a point charge gives off a radial field, any integral of flux across a closed surface containing a point charge will be proportional to the charge contained within (gauss's law), you should draw some pictures and try and intuitively get why this is true. The divergence theorem says the volume integral of the divergence of a equals the integral of flux across the surface of said volume, so the volume integral of the divergence is also proportional to the contained charge. Then differentiate both sides with respect to volume, and you can see that the divergence is equal to the charge per volume, or charge density.",

        "response": "Some boats, very high performance ones, do have transmissions. But for most normal boats, this adds a lot of complexity and, most of all, cost. The other factor is that water behaves very differently than air. Water resists being pushed out of the way, and the harder you push, the harder it pushes back. The fancy term is compressibility. It's because of this that a fall from a great height into water tends to be like hitting concrete.  So, back to the boat. As you spin the propeller faster and faster, it gets harder and harder to turn. Also, the drag of the water against the hull increases, requiring more effort. So, a boat in water is like a car that is going up a very steep hill. It needs to gear down to maintain speed or accelerate. With a boat, it works out that most of the time you only need one or two gears.",

I think kidneys are implanted whole, hopefully in bigger children. These also can hypertrophy (get bigger) as needed. Hearts would be very unusual. Not sure it could work without a similar sized donor. As far as I know (not a paediatric transplant surgeon!) the goal is to delay transplant as long as possible so sizes work better. So in the heart they do a while bunch of weird operations like cutting out bad pieces and sticking vessels in weird spots, as a temporary measure. Past that, I think the odds of getting a super-specialist in here are low, but there will be tons of case reports in the literature. Just google \"paediatric transplant\" with the organ of interest",

That's when you feel stuffed up, blow our nose, but nothing comes out. However, sometime there is an overproduction of mucus. However, if you were to remove that completely, the results would be worse than any runny nose you've ever had. A lack of mucus production would lead to a dried out cavity that would crack, bleed, etc. Any opening to the body (mouth, nose, genitalia, etc) needs to remain well lubricated for proper functioning of your immune system among other functions as well.",

Noether's Theorem identifies conserved quantities, which means that you have something that can take all sorts of values, but for any given (isolated) system, its value won't change. Thus, for example, in two different collisions, the momentum will be conserved, but the value of the momentum in each case can be different. The idea is that if you set an initial value for something, the equations of motion are such that that something does not change its value -- but different initial conditions would have produced a different value. The speed of light is a constant of nature. It has the same value no matter who does the observing, no matter the situation. The constancy of the speed of light is still associated with a symmetry; [Lorentz invariance](_URL_0_) is the symmetry that causes there to be a speed that takes the same value for all observers.",

But once another, non-gravitational force acts on the object, it follows a *curved* path through curved spacetime (just like in Newtonian mechanics, an external force causes an acceleration); in your example of holding a pen, the force is just enough to curve the pen's trajectory through spacetime so that it stays at rest relative to the Earth.

        "response": "Your body reacts to coldness by decreasing blood flow in your limbs in order to keep your core on operating temperature. As low blood flow = less function, your fingers and toes start feeling numb and you lose dexterity as they're stiffing up, which is all a result of your nerves being numbed as well. But interestingly enough, probably for safety reasons, your pain receptors still work, unlike many others. So this means, that the input you normally have is \"turned off\", while pain is the only one still being \"transmitted\", which can be compared to being on a concert with a crying baby next to you (you won't really notice) or being in a quiet room with the same baby (really annoying).",

        "response": "China had a civil war that ended in approximately 1949. The communists won and the nationalists lost. The nationalists fled to Taiwan, a large island off the coast of mainland China. The situation has been tense and complicated since then. Taiwan's economy boomed to unbelievable extent, and the mainland Chinese want to incorporate them into mainland China. If there is another huge war in the near to medium term, this is one of the places it could start.",

The sound then will be blurred out, creating a \"far off\" sort of distortion. Sounds from close by are clearer as they haven't been blurred out in this way. There are rooms that have been so completely isolated from sound and echoes that you actually will not be able to tell the distance by sound alone. Lots of strange things happen to sounds in these rooms.",

If there is a 50-50 chance as to which team will win, the odds of the Jays winning all 10 is 1 in 1024. This comes from (1/2)^(10). Note, however, as you went into this year already knowing that the Jays won the first 9 games, if you ask what are the odds that the streak would extend from 9 to 10, that is just the odds of single win, which is 1 in 2 (in the approximation I'm using).",

        "response": "Yes, a fever helps in two main ways: First, most things that make us sick, like viruses or bacteria, have adapted to our very specific body temp - ~37C or ~98F. When our body finds something inside us that isn't us, it raised the temperature a bit to make it harder for those germs. Second, a bunch of parts of the immune system work better at slightly higher temperatures. The cells that eat bacteria and viruses, for example, are better at it when the temperature is a just a little higher than our regular body temp.  So when we have an infection, our body raises its temperature a little bit to make life harder for the bugs, and easier for the things that kill them.  & nbsp; It's similar for other symptoms. Mucus in your nose helps catch things so they can't get any further inside. Coughing and sneezing expels bad things. A lot of the unpleasantness of being sick is our own body fighting the germs, rather than caused by the germs themselves, but these things help us get better faster.",
