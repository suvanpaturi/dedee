These detectors use lasers to measure tiny, minuscule changes in distance caused by the passing of gravitational waves through the Earth's atmosphere and the instrument. One of the most famous gravitational wave detectors is the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO).\n\nWhen two neutron stars merge together, they emit intense gravitational waves that ripple through the fabric of spacetime. These gravitational waves cause minute fluctuations in the lengths of the arms of the LIGO detector, which can be measured and analyzed to determine the characteristics of the gravitational waves and the collision that caused them. By studying the data from these detectors, astrophysicists are able to detect and study these elusive and fascinating phenomena.",

The reflected hole carries opposite spin and charge and forms a Cooper pair with another electron in the superconductor.\n\nProximity-induced superconductivity (CI) refers to the phenomenon where a thin layer of a superconductor in contact with a normal metal can induce superconductivity in the metal due to the proximity effect. This effect is due to the exchange of Cooper pair excitations between the two materials.\n\nCoherent oscillations of Andreev reflected electrons (CORS) are the result of the interference patterns created between the different paths that Andreev-reflected electrons can take as they propagate through a normal metal-superconductor junction.\n\nThe interconnection between these phenomena lies in the fact that Andreev reflection and CI play a crucial role in the formation and manipulation of Cooper pairs, which are at the heart of superconductivity. CORS, on the other hand, provides valuable insight into the nature of Andreev reflection and the behavior of Cooper pairs in non-equilibrium conditions.

        "response": "Scientists are not necessarily atheists. According to a 2009 Pew poll, 59% of scientists believe there is a God or higher power. In other words, the majority of scientists are not atheists. This makes sense because there is nothing fundamental in science that would require a good scientist to turn away all religion. Science and religion deal with entirely different facets of existence. Science is not an alternative to religion, because it is not a religion at all. Science is not a particular tradition spelled out by a handful of geniuses. In fact, there is no such thing as one, golden-standard Scientific Method. Rather, science is an umbrella term that encompasses all physical truths that are arrived at through repeated observations and through the application of models that successfully predict observations. Science is confined strictly to the observable world, and therefore has nothing to say about any non-observable realm. A scientist that claims that science proves God does not exist is simply a poor scientist. Such a scientist has turned science into his own personal religion. Honest and logically consistent scientists may privately lean towards atheism or towards religion, but they know that science itself is agnostic. Scientists are free to be atheists in good faith, but that is just their personal faith and is not supported by science. Claiming that a strictly observation-based methodology such as science has anything to say about physically unobservable realms is simply illogical. Religion deals mainly with the field of physically unobservable entities: good, evil, love, hate, holiness, sin, spirit, heaven, and God. While the spiritual realm is beyond physical observation, most religions believe that it is still accessible to the human experience through non-physical senses which are given names such as enlightenment, the soul, the inner spirit, the mind's eye, inspiration, consciousness, etc. Because science and religion address different planes of existence using different tools, they are not mutually exclusive. Science versus religion is a false dichotomy. Pure religion (as opposed to forms of religion that have been misused for political purposes) is not at war with science, and in fact, cannot be. In some cases, science and religion seem to contradict each other, but closer scrutiny reveals that these cases consist of instances where science has wandered beyond its bounds of the observable world, or religious interpretation has wandered beyond its scope of the spiritual world. For instance, extracting tidbits from the Christian bible and interpreting them broadly as scientific facts about the age and development of the earth gives you Creation Science, which is both bad religion and bad science. The Creation Science movement is bad religion because it attempts to take passages meant mainly for spiritual, non-observable purposes, and extrapolate them to have vast scientific meaning. The Creation Science movement is also bad science because it contradicts the wealth of observed data collected by mainstream science. In a similar way, taking neuroscience findings about the brain and extending them to make broad claims about the nature of free will is both bad science and bad religion. Consider two visitors to an art gallery, Tom and Sally. Tom is fixed on a painting of the ocean, while Sally is gazing upon an entirely different painting of roses. Each is so absorbed so as to be unaware of the other person's gaze. The conversation progresses something like this. Tom: \"What a beautiful hue of blue.\"\r\nSally: \"What? There isn't a single stroke of blue in the whole painting. It's mostly red.\"\r\nTom: \"Are you blind? Half of the painting is blue. Look down in the bottom right corner of the painting where the blue is the brightest. You can't honestly tell me that is not blue.\"\r\nSally: \"You must mean the top right corner. I'll give it to you that there is a patch of sky in that corner, but it's more gray than blue.\" Trying to prove anything with a conversation like this is pointless, as the visitors are looking at entirely different paintings. There is no war between science and religion. There is only war between bad science and bad religion. Bad science is the application of scientific (observable) concepts to the spiritual (unobservable) realm. Bad religion is the application of spiritual concepts to the scientific realm. In other other words, there is only war between science and religion posing as science, as well as between religion and science posing as religion. Historically, there has also been war between science and political powers who used the cloak of religion for political purposes, but this really has nothing to do with pure religion which concerns itself with the spiritual realm. The false notion that there is a fundamental clash between science and religion is promulgated mainly by three groups: 1) anti-religious factions that try to use science to attack religion, 2) anti-science factions that try to use religion to attack science, and 3) journalists looking to sell articles. Group 1 includes aggressive atheists who in their zeal to tear down religion misuse science. Group 2 includes religionists who are so insecure in their faith that they feel that anything they don't understand must be wrong. Group 3 includes journalists who know that drama sells, so they are willing to create drama between science and religion where there is little.",

        "query": "Why are truck drivers rude?",
        "response": "Truck drivers are professional operators and are therefore less rude on the road in general than your typical driver. Truck drivers are often perceived to be rude for one simple reason: inertia. Inertia (also called \"momentum\" or \"Newton's First Law\") means that an object in motion tends to stay in motion and resists change to its motion. Momentum is the product of two things: mass and speed. The higher the mass of an object, the more momentum it has, and the harder it is to stop or turn. Similarly, the faster an object is traveling, the more momentum it has and the harder it is to stop or turn. A bullet shot from a gun can do so much damage because it is traveling very fast despite being so light. Also, a road roller can do so much damage to your foot because it is very massive despite going very slowly. Large trucks are very massive compared to normals cars. Fully loaded, a semi-trailer truck has a mass 20 to 50 times that of a four-wheeled automobile. This fact means that it is 20 to 50 times harder to stop or turn a truck than a car simply because of its momentum. While a truck has a stronger engine, better brakes, and more wheels to help compensate for more inertia, these components are not magic. The bottom line is that a truck takes much longer to get up to speed and to slow down than a car because it is so massive. Also, trucks can not turn or change lanes as quickly as cars, as their high inertia would tip them over. It is simple physics at work and has nothing to do with driver attitudes or styles. When a truck does not suddenly slow down to give your car room to merge onto a highway, it is not because the driver is rude. It is because the truck is so massive that it physically can not suddenly slow down. When a truck behind your car seems to be bearing down and you think he should back off, most likely you slowed down faster than the truck was able. His inertia carried him right onto your tail without the driver being able to do anything about it. If a truck seems to be going exceptionally slow around a sharp curve and is therefore in your way, realize that if he went faster he would likely tip over from his huge inertia. When changing lanes and expecting a truck to yield to you or make space for you, and he doesn't, he most likely can't. The heavier the load in the truck, the more inertia, and the more the truck has to drive like a lumbering beast. According to Report 400 of the National Cooperative Highway Research Program, cars require a minimum of between 450 and 900 feet in order to brake to a stop from a speed of 70 mph on a wet road. In contrast, trucks require a minimum of between 700 and 1400 feet to stop from the same speed under the same conditions. These spreads in values depend mostly on the state of the tires. Therefore, a truck with bad tires needs three times the distance of a car with good tires in order to screech to a stop from highway speed, even with the brakes completely engaged. The best thing to do around trucks is to give them plenty of space, so they can safely turn, speed up, and slow down. Also, when merging to the same lane at the same time, the lighter vehicle should always yield to the more massive vehicle, as the more massive vehicle has more inertia and will have a harder time yielding.",

These oscillations can provide information about the star’s age, mass, radius, and other physical properties.\n\nThe age of a star can be estimated from its asteroseismic properties such as the frequency and amplitude of its oscillations. The radius of the star can also be determined from these oscillations, which reveal how much the star expands and contracts during its oscillation period.\n\nUsing the Kepler data, astronomers have estimated the ages and radii of thousands of stars. For example, the estimated age and radius of Kepler-10, a star located approximately 560 light-years away from us, is around 10.1 billion years and 0.56 times the radius of the Sun, respectively.",

        "query": "Why do scientists write so well?",
        "response": "From my experience, scientists do not write spectacularly well. As a peer reviewer of physics journal articles, and as a supervisor of student dissertations, I have often been shocked at the poor grammar, spelling, and formatting of scientists' manuscripts. Too often, my evaluation of a paper as a peer reviewer has effectively stated, \"The science in this paper is solid, but the English is unacceptable. The following changes must be made before I can recommend this paper for publication...\" Of course, this observation is a generalization. There are scientists who are amazing writers, and there are those who are failures. But, on average, scientists are not particularly amazing writers in my experience. Perhaps scientists are so interested in the actual science they are presenting, that they fail to devote much attention or energy to the quality of their writings. Or perhaps they are just human. In any case, the quality of the language matters. The purpose of a scientific paper is to convey information. If the language is poor, it will fail to properly convey the information, no matter how amazing the underlying experiment may have been. How can the writings of scientists seem so well constructed if scientists don't write particularly well? There are perhaps two reasons: peer review, and technical terms. Peer review is used so that scientists do not publish bad science. When several people check the scientific results and derivations in a paper, the experimental mistakes, mathematical errors, and unjustified leaps in logic can be identified. While peer review is mostly used to weed out bad science, it also has the effect of weeding out bad writing. By the time a paper makes it into a journal and in front of the readers' eyes, it has typically been through two rounds of peer review. The first round is initiated by the author himself. Typically, the scientist puts together a paper he wants to publish and then has his collaborators and colleagues proof-read the paper. The author does this to ensure the paper is neither misrepresenting their contributions nor propagating bad science that may taint them by association. The second round of peer review is carried out by the journal. The journal selects a few anonymous reviewers that are scientists in the same field as the paper and forwards the submitted paper to the reviewers. After all the changes are made that the reviewers requested, the paper is published (assuming it contains research worth publishing). In each step along the way, a human reads the paper and identifies language mistakes that need to be corrected. In this way, the final product has far better language than a single scientist could produce. The other effect that may lead you to think that scientists are good writers is the proper use of technical terms. In science, certain words and acronyms are given strict definitions and attached to complex concepts. This creation of a technical language that is specific to a field enables very rapid communication of very complicated ideas. For instance, instead of writing that, \"the laser used that effect that happens when electromagnetic waves hit the interface between two materials and excite a quantized collective oscillation of electric charge on the surface that becomes self-sustaining through self-interacting electromagnetic fields,\" we can just say, \"the laser used surface plasmons.\" When people who work in a certain technical field hear a phrase from their field, they immediately have a wealth of information conveyed to them. Simply learning a science gets you acquainted with the technical terms of that science and makes you able to use those terms, without you being a particularly good writer. In contrast, someone who has not really learned the science (but thinks he has) will use the technical terms incorrectly, or may even not use them at all. But a scientist who is educated in his field uses the technical terms correctly without much effort. For this reason, a paper written by a scientist looks like it contains advanced language, when it really just contains advanced science which has built-in shortcut phrases for complex ideas. Here are some common English mistakes that I have seen scientists make (myself included) and that we would all do well to avoid:",

Detailed maps of today's submarine cables can be found on websites such as www.submarinecablemap.com. Satellite links currently account for only about 1% of international telecommunications. The rest travels through undersea cables. The reason for such a high use of submarine cables is that they can carry much more information per second and are much more reliable. The first submarine cables were simple metal wires carrying telegraph signals. Later on, metal cables were laid that could carry telephone and data signals. Finally, optical fiber cables carrying light signals began to be laid under the oceans in the 1980's because optical fiber signals are faster and can carry more information than metal-based signals.
