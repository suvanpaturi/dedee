However, for discontinuous functions like the square wave, the Fourier series has some peculiarities.\n\nThe square wave can be represented as follows:\n\nf(x)= 1 for 0\u2264x\u2264\u03c0, and f(x)=-1 for \u03c0\u2264x\u22642\u03c0.\n\nThe Fourier series for this function is given by:\n\nf(x)= (4/\u03c0) * sum[(1/n)*sin(n*x)] from n = 1 to infinity\n\nHere, we can see that the series converges for every x value in the interval [0, 2\u03c0], except at the points where the function has jumps (i.e., x=0, \u03c0, 2\u03c0). However, the convergence is not uniform. The series converges very slowly near these jump points and faster elsewhere. This is an example of tangential convergence.",

However, if the boxes are not perfectly aligned, there will be some degree of random variation in the twist angle from one box to the next.\n\nIn a similar way, twist field correlation in a material is affected by factors such as the orientation of its crystals, the presence of defects or impurities, and external forces acting on the material.

The only problem with this exercise in extrapolation is that trends did not continue. Birth rates have been steadily declining. U.S. Census Beareau data shows that the global population growth rate in 1980 was almost 2%. The rate today (2012) is about 1% and steadily dropping. If every family in the world had a house and if every house were stacked end-to-end and front-to-back in one gigantic complex, the entire current world population could be housed in California alone. And this calculation does not include the possibility of building up. If people were to live in 100-story high apartment buildings stacked end-to-end, front-to-back, and top-to-bottom, then the entire world population could be housed in San Diego alone. The problem with over-population disaster scenarios made by alarmists is that they typically extrapolate the population growth but don't extrapolate the advance of technology. The improvement in agricultural efficiency, medicine, and residential construction has out-paced the growth in population. As a result, the world's standard of living has on average improved, despite the population growth. This effect will continue in the future. It's true that there are ever more mouths to feed and cars to fill with gasoline, but there are also ever better ways being developed to make food and extract gasoline. Even if thousands of years hence the earth did begin to approach dangerous levels of population and technological progress stalled, the decline in quality of life would naturally lead to lower birth rates long before the situation ever became cataclysmic.

        "response": "First of all, elevators never plummet down their shafts. For the past century, elevators have had a backup break that automatically engages when an elevator starts to fall. If all the cables snapped (highly unlikely), the elevator would only fall a few feet before the safety breaks would activate. The safety breaks are mechanical so that they work even if power is out or no one is around. Secondly, even if a terrorist managed to saw off the huge metal breaks and cut all the cables, the plummeting elevator would land on a cushion of air at the bottom. The elevator shaft traps air much like a giant air bag, which would soften the blow. But the essence of the original question is still interesting. Imagine that you are standing on a high, heavy, outdoor platform (with holes in it so that air resistance is negligible). Suppose the platform's supports break so that you and the platform fall together. Could you minimize the damage of hitting the ground by jumping off the platform at the last second? If we neglect air resistance, the answer is a weak yes. But because you are both in free fall, you would not really be \u201cjumping\u201d off the platform, but would be pushing it away. By the law of conservation of momentum, pushing the platform downwards will give it some of your momentum and slow you down. (Think of a speeding ice skater pushing another stationary ice skater. The speeding skater slows down.) The platform has to be heavy in order to be able to give it much of your momentum. Pushing against a penny won't do much unless you shoot the penny off at high speed using a gun. But pushing away a heavy platform will give it more momentum. The first question to approach is: when is the best time to push off the platform? If you go through the kinematic equations (neglecting air resistance), you can indeed show that your ground impact velocity is minimized by jumping close to the last second. If you jump exactly at the last moment, the platform will not have time to receive your momentum, and hit the ground. So it is best to jump close to the last moment. Simple mathematics show that near impact your impact velocity is just your free-fall-acquired final velocity minus your jump velocity. Your jump velocity is how much upward velocity you gain by pushing away the platform. Assuming the maximum human jump velocity to be 7 mph, if your platform fell from 33 feet (about three floors), you would reduce your impact velocity from 31 mph to 25 mph by pushing the platform down with all your might near the last moment possible. If you fell from 165 feet (about 15 floors), pushing at the right moment would reduce your impact velocity from 72 mph to 65 mph. The bottom line is that \u201cjumping\u201d at the last moment would help, but not much. Of course, the actual damage depend not only on your impact velocity, but also on the solidity of the ground. Cement will do more damage than haystacks. These calculations neglect air resistance, which would also help slow you down. Air resistance would be another reason to stick close to the platform until late in the fall. In practical situations where the ground is soft and the platform is hard, it may be more important to jump clear of the platform early on to avoid its impact shrapnel than to try to give it your momentum.",

        "query": "Is there any difference between antimatter, dark matter, dark energy, and degenerate matter?",
        "response": "Yes. Although the names sound vague and almost fictional, the types of matter called antimatter, dark matter, dark energy, and degenerate matter are all different, specific entities that really exist in our universe. Antimatter is just regular matter with a few properties flipped, such as the electric charge. For example, the antimatter version of an electron is a positron. They both have the same mass, but have opposite electric charge. Antimatter is not as exotic as science fiction makes it out to be. For starters, antimatter has regular mass and accelerates in response to forces just like regular matter. Also, antimatter is gravitationally attracted to other forms of matter just like regular matter. For every particle that exists, there is an antimatter counterpart (some particles such as photons are their own anti-particles). What makes antimatter unique is that when antimatter comes in contact with its regular matter counterpart, they mutually destroy each other and all of their mass is converted to energy. This matter-antimatter mutual annihilation has been observed many times and is a well-established principle. In fact, medical PET scans routinely use annihilation events in order to form images of patients. Antimatter is therefore only distinct from regular matter in that it annihilates when meeting regular matter. For instance, a proton and a positron are somewhat similar. They both have regular mass. They both have a positive electric charge of the same strength. They both have a quantum spin of one half. But when a proton meets an electron, it forms a stable hydrogen atom. When a positron meets an electron, they destroy each other. The key difference is that a positron is antimatter and a proton is not. Antimatter is very rare in our universe compared to regular matter, but there are small amounts of antimatter all over the place in the natural world, including inside your body. Antimatter is created by many types of radioactive decay, such as by the decay of potassium-40. When you eat a banana, you are eating trace amounts of antimatter-producing atoms. The amount is so small, that it does not really affect your health. But it is still there. Why doesn't antimatter build up in your body? The key is that our universe is mostly made of regular matter, so antimatter cannot stick around for very long. Very soon after antimatter is created, it bumps into regular matter and gets destroyed again. Antimatter is also produced by lightning and cosmic rays. It is well understood by physicists, and is predicted by standard particle physics theories. Dark matter is matter that does not interact electromagnetically, and therefore cannot be seen using light. At the same time, dark matter does interact gravitationally and can therefore be \"seen\" through its gravitational effect on other matter. It is common throughout the universe and helps shape galaxies. In fact, recent estimates put dark matter as five times more common than regular matter in our universe. But because dark matter does not interact electromagnetically, we can't touch it, see it, or manipulate it using conventional means. You could, in principle, manipulate dark matter using gravitational forces. The problem is that the gravitational force is so weak that you need planet-sized masses in order to gravitationally manipulate human-sized objects. There remains much unknown about dark matter since it is so hard to detect and manipulate. Dark matter is not predicted or explained by standard particle physics theories but is a crucial part of the Big Bang model. Dark energy is an energy on the universal scale that is pushing apart galaxies and causing the universe to expand at an increasing rate. Like dark matter, dark energy is poorly understood and is not directly detectable using conventional means. Several lines of evidence make it clear that our universe is expanding. Not only that, our universe is expanding at an increasing rate. Dark energy is the name of the poorly understood mechanism that drives this accelerating expansion. While dark matter tends to bring matter together, dark energy tends to push matter apart. Dark energy is weak and mostly operates only on the intergalactic scale where gravitational attraction of dark matter and regular matter is negligible. Dark energy is thought to be spread thinly but evenly throughout the entire universe. Dark energy is also not predicted or explained by standard particle physics theories but is included in modern versions of the Big Bang model. Dark energy may have a connection with the vacuum energy predicted by particle physics, but the connection is currently unclear. Degenerate matter is regular matter that has been compressed until the atoms break down and the particles lock into a giant mass. Degenerate matter acts somewhat like a gas in that the particles are not bound to each other, and somewhat like a solid in that the particles are packed so closely that they cannot move much. A white dwarf star is mostly composed of electrons compressed into a state of degenerate matter. A neutron star is mostly composed of degenerate neutrons. Further compression of a neutron star may transform it to a quark star, which is a star composed of quarks in a degenerate state. But not enough is known about quarks to determine at present whether quark stars really exist or are even possible.\r\nThese concepts are summarized in the list below.

The alignment of the spins is known as spontaneous magnetization and gives rise to the magnetic properties of the material. The behavior of the magnetic properties in ferromagnets is studied using nonergodic thermodynamics.\n\nNonergodic thermodynamics helps in understanding the behavior of ferromagnets under non-equilibrium conditions, such as when the material is subjected to an external magnetic field. This leads to reversible and irreversible changes in the magnetic properties of the material. The irreversible changes in the magnetic properties are due to the presence of defects in the material that result in a change in the magnetic moment.\n\nNonergodic thermodynamics also helps in understanding the behavior of ferromagnets at different temperatures. The magnetic properties of ferromagnets change with temperature due to changes in the thermal energy of the material. At high temperatures, the magnetic properties of the material decrease until the material loses its magnetic properties altogether, known as the Curie temperature. \n\nIn summary, nonergodic thermodynamics is an important tool for studying the magnetic properties of ferromagnets, including their behavior under non-equilibrium conditions and at different temperatures.",

This force arises when charges accumulate on an object. If enough charge accumulates, the electric force can push further electrons away from the object and resist further acceleration.\n\nLastly, there is also the force of frictional resistance due to collisions with atoms or molecules in a medium, which can limit electron acceleration.",

        "response": "The sense of smell does not really work that way. If an odor, such as the smell of a strawberry, is not chemically reactive enough to do damage, your sense of smell will remain unharmed no matter how strong the smell becomes. In this way, the sense of smell is very different from the sense of sight and the sense of hearing. The brightness of a light is a measure of its energy content. A brighter beam of light carries more energy. Therefore, light can be bright enough that it dumps enough energy into your eyes to damage them. Similarly, the loudness of a sound is a measure of its energy content. A louder sound carries more energy. In this way, sound can be loud enough to dump enough energy into your ears to cause damage. In contrast, the strength of a particular odor is not a measure of its energy content, but is a measure of the number of odor molecules in a given volume. A stronger concentration of a particular order that reaches your nose is not dumping more energy in your nose. It is dumping more odor molecules in your nose. Your nose contains an array of smell receptors (olfactory nerves). When the odor molecules bind to these smell receptors, they trigger a signal to the brain telling it that something was smelled. The more odor molecules there are present, the more binding there is to the smell receptors, and the stronger the smell signal that reaches your brain. If a particular non-toxic odor is too strong, this just means that it carries too many odor molecules for your sense receptors to bind to, and not that it is dumping too much energy into your nose. Therefore, if a particular odor is not toxic, it will do no damage no matter how strong the smell becomes. If the smell of bacon gets too strong, you simply stop noticing that the smell is getting stronger because your sense receptors are saturated, but no damage is done and no pain is felt. Odors that are chemically reactive enough will affect your sense receptors at any concentration. At low concentrations, the effect is minimal. At higher concentrations, the inhaled toxic chemical can lead to nasal irritation, long-term damage, and even cancer. For example, hydogen sulfide gives a recognizable rotten-egg smell at a concentration of about 5 parts per billion, becomes annoying at about 100 parts per billion, causes irritation at about 10,000 parts per billion, and causes lasting damage and even death at higher concentrations. In the textbook Taste and Smell Disorders edited by Allen M. Seiden, the authors Lloyd Hastings and Marian L. Miller write, \"Among the many causes leading to decrements in olfactory function, exposure to toxic compounds, especially those airborne, represents a small but important percentage of the cases presenting for evaluation...Exposure to levels of irritants sufficient to alter olfactory function usually occurs only after accidental exposure.\"",

This means that if you apply the differential operator to a function that is invariant under the adjoint action, you get another function that is also invariant under the adjoint action.\n\nNow, it turns out that the combination of these two properties implies that the Harish-Chandra integral is nilpotent. This means that if you apply the Harish-Chandra integral repeatedly to a function, eventually you will get the zero function.

When the size of the nanowire becomes comparable to the electronic wavelength of the material, the electrons are confined within the wire and begin to behave as if they are in a quantum state. \n\nThis behavior causes the electrons to form Cooper pairs, which are pairs of electrons that become bound together due to the attraction between them. These Cooper pairs move through the material with little resistance, resulting in superconductivity. \n\nThus, Bi nanowires exhibit superconductivity due to their small size, which allows the electrons to behave in a quantum-mechanical way and form Cooper pairs.",

It is based on the principle that a time series can be approximated by a polynomial function, and that the degree of smoothing can be controlled by adjusting the degree of the polynomial used.\n\nThe formula for calculating the Gevrey smoothing effect is:\n\ny(t) = \u03a3n=0 to \u221e c_n (x(t))^n\n\nwhere y(t) is the smoothed value at time t, x(t) is the original time series value at time t, and c_n are coefficients that depend on the degree of smoothing (n).\n\nFor example, if the degree of smoothing is set to 1, then the formula becomes:\n\ny(t) = c_0 + c_1 (x(t))\n\nwhere c_0 and c_1 are constants that control the amount of smoothing. Higher values of n will result in greater smoothing, but may also lead to overfitting and loss of important features in the data.",

        "query": "How can science solve all of our problems?",
        "response": "Science can not solve all of our problems. While scientific understanding can help battle things like disease, hunger, and poverty when applied properly, it does not do so completely and automatically. Furthermore, there are many areas of life where science can have little impact. Let us look at some of the reasons why this is so. First of all, there is a huge difference between knowing something and acting on it. Science is concerned with accumulating and understanding observations of the physical world. That understanding alone solves no problems. Individual people have to act on that understanding for it to help solve problems. For instance, science has found that regular exercise can lower your risk of heart disease. Knowing this fact is interesting, but it will do nothing for your personal heath unless you act on it and actually exercise. And that's the hard part. Reading an article about exercise is easy. Getting into an actual routine of regular exercise is harder. In this sense, science really solves no problems at all. Problems are only solved when people take the knowledge (or tool, or pill, or whatever) provided by science and use it. In fact, many of humanity's biggest problems are caused by lack of action, and not lack of knowledge. Take world hunger, for example. There is currently enough food produced on the earth every year to comfortably feed every single person. The world produces about 700 trillion grams of rice each year. With seven billion people on the planet, 365 days in the year, and about 40 grams per typical serving of rice, there is enough rice on the planet to feed every single last person seven servings of rice every day. And this is just rice. Similar numbers hold up for wheat, corn, meat, etc. Science has done an amazing job in the last 50 years of making farms productive. And yet, millions of people in the world still suffer starvation. Why? Because of actions. If all it took was science to solve problems, no one would go hungry anymore because there is enough food. We could fill books with the analysis of human actions that cause world hunger if we wanted to, but let's just focus on a few factors to illustrate the point. A large portion of the world's food is simply wasted by lazy humans. People in affluent countries buy more food than they need, so that much of their food goes rotten and must be tossed before it is eaten. Or they pile more food on their plate than they could possibly eat and much of the food ends up in the trash. Another major factor is corrupt or incompetent governments who hoard food among a select few, poorly distribute food, or refuse to adopt modern agricultural methods. Tyrants sometimes even use forced hunger as a way to subdue the masses or punish opponents. Science can make an acre of farmland amazingly productive, but it can't force a dictator to give back the food he has stolen from his people. Secondly, science can only tell us what exists and not what we should want as humans. Science can answer questions such as \"is the average global temperature increasing?\" but can never answer questions such as \"what should humans do about global warming?\" Such a question really depends on what humans want. Some humans want to be free to enjoy gas-guzzling trucks regardless of what long-term impacts this may have on the environment, while others want to force everyone to give up such freedoms in order to protect the environment. Settling who is \"right\" in such a debate is largely a matter of ethics, morality, and opinion; not science. If I am personally on the environmental side of the debate and am frustrated that countries can't pass more stringent environmental laws, my real problem is that too many people want something different (freedom) from what I want (environmental controls). Science can build cars that emit less pollution, but it cannot force people to drive those cars. It takes laws to force people to drive environmentally friendly cars, and laws are just the written wishes of the majority of the people (or of dictators). Many of the \"problems\" that are discussed in the political sphere are not really problems at all in the scientific sense. They are simply a clash of human wants: one large faction wants one thing and the other faction wants something else. No one is really \"right\" in the scientific sense in such cases (although, fervent partisans are usually convinced they are always right and their opponents are always wrong). For instance, is it better to let the free market run a nation's healthcare system or should the government take over? The answer to this question really depends on how you define \"better\", which depends entirely on what you personally want. To people that want freedom above all else, \"better\" will mean letting the free market provide healthcare. To humans that want a uniform system that won't let people fall through the cracks, \"better\" may mean centralized medicine. The point is that neither side of the debate is \"better\" in a scientific sense, so science can never solve this problem. Science can save more lives through medical breakthroughs, and can even streamline the healthcare bureaucracy, but it can't find out if government-run or market-run healthcare is better, because \"better\" is so subjective. The same situation exists for many \"problems\" debated in the political sphere. For this reason, scientists do not make good political leaders. The role of political leaders is to ascertain and carry out the wants of the people, which science is fundamentally not equipped to do. Lastly, many areas of life are simply too non-physical to be satisfactorily addressed by science. Love, hate, relationships, poetry, art, music, literature, and spirituality are all outside the realm of science. Any problems that arise in these areas cannot be completely solved by science.",

For example, if an electric field is applied to a metallic sample, the electrons will experience a force that causes them to move in a way that generates an electric current. However, because of the strong interactions between the electrons, the current flow will be affected by scattering and other collective effects that are not present in ideal non-interacting Fermi gases.\n\nSimilarly, when a Fermi liquid is subjected to a magnetic field, the response depends on the strength and direction of the field, as well as the detailed nature of the interactions between the electrons.

        "response": "The sun does not run out of oxygen for the simple fact that it does not use oxygen to burn. The burning of the sun is not chemical combustion. It is nuclear fusion. Don't think of the sun as a giant campfire. It is more like a giant hydrogen bomb. In standard carbon combustion, carbon atoms in the fuel move up close to oxygen atoms in the air and bond together to make carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. At the same time, hydrogen atoms in the fuel bond with oxygen atoms to make water molecules. There are often other chemical reactions occurring in a carbon-based fire, but the combustion of carbon and hydrogen atoms are the main ones. This combustion releases energy which we experience as the heat and light given off by the flame. Most of the fires that we see in everyday life are carbon combustion: campfires, oven flames, candle flames, barbecue grills, forest fires, gas furnaces, gasoline burning in engines, etc. The key to remember is that carbon combustion requires oxygen. As soon as there is no oxygen left, carbon combustion stops. In nuclear fusion, the nuclei of atoms are fused together to make new, bigger nuclei. Since the nucleus of an atom determines what the atom is and how it behaves, a change to the nucleus causes the atom to become a new element. For instance, two hydrogen atoms fuse together to make one helium atom. Nuclear fusion does not require oxygen. In fact, you don't need any other material at all. You just need enough pressure or heat to squeeze the nuclei of the atoms close enough that they overcome their electrostatic repulsion and bond into a single nucleus. In a nuclear fusion bomb, the intense pressures and temperatures are provided by other bombs. In a tokamak nuclear fusion reactor, the intense pressures and temperatures are provided by magnetic confinement fields, by the insertion of electromagnetic waves, and by the injection of high-energy particles. In stars, the intense pressures and temperatures are provided by gravity. A star has such large mass that the gravity created by this mass crushes the star inward enough to ignite nuclear fusion. Nuclear fusion in stars releases immense amounts of energy, which we ultimately experience as sunlight. The energy released by fusion also helps sustain the nuclear fusion reaction. Our sun has a core temperature of 16 million Kelvin and a core pressure of 25 thousand trillion Newtons per square meter. The sun gets so hot from its nuclear fusion that it glows and emits light, just like how a piece of metal glows red if you heat it up. There are two main forces at work in nuclear fusion: the electromagnetic force and the strong nuclear force. The repulsive electromagnetic force between positively-charge nuclei is long-range but relatively weak, while the attractive strong nuclear force is short-range but strong. When two nuclei are far enough apart, the repulsive electromagnetic force dominates, holding the nuclei apart. As the two nuclei get closer, the electromagnetic repulsion gets stronger and it gets harder and harder to push the nuclei together. When the two nuclei get close enough, the attractive short-range nuclear force dominates and the two nuclei stick together to form a new nucleus. For this reason, it takes a lot of pressure to push nuclei close enough that they fuse together. In principle, any two nuclei can be fused into a single nucleus. However, it is the easiest to fuse (and the most energy is released from) nuclei that have little electromagnetic repulsion because they have little electric charge. The nuclei with the least electric charge are the lighter elements, such as hydrogen and helium. In stars, most of the fusion taking place is hydrogen fusing with itself or with other light elements. Since gravity is what provides the pressure to ignite nuclear fusion in stars, and since gravity is caused by mass, all you need is a big enough mass of hydrogen in order to end up with burning stars. There is very little oxygen in stars. The oxygen that is there was created by hydrogen fusing repeatedly until it made the oxygen.",

        "query": "Why is ice slippery?",
        "response": "On its own, ice is not slippery. When you step onto an icy sidewalk, you do indeed feel a slippery surface. But the slipperiness is caused by a thin layer of liquid water and not directly by the solid ice itself. Water on a smooth surface is slippery because water is a low-viscosity liquid. As such, there are no permanent intermolecular bonds in liquid water, and the transient intermolecular bonds are weak. This means that water molecules can move about freely, slide past each other easily, and fill any microscopic holes or cracks that would snag an object. But how does water get on the ice in the first place? This is a harder question to answer. For many years, scientists thought that the cause was pressure. When you apply pressure to water, you do indeed lower its melting point. In 1886, engineer John Joly proposed that the weight of a person skating on ice created enough pressure to lower the melting point of ice below the ambient temperature, thus causing the ice to melt to a thin layer of water under the skates. But this explanation does not hold up to closer scrutiny. No matter how much pressure you apply, you can't lower the melting point of water below -22 degrees Celsius. And yet, ice at temperatures lower than this still exhibits the formation of a slippery liquid layer. While pressure can play a role, it is not the dominant effect. In 1939, Frank P. Bowden and T. P. Hughes proposed that the friction of objects sliding on the ice causes it to heat up enough to melt. While friction does indeed cause heat, it does not create enough heat to melt ice that is at a very low temperature. And yet, ice at low temperature still forms a slippery liquid layer. Also, frictional heating cannot explain why a slippery layer forms even if the object is perfectly motionless. While frictional heating can play a role in reducing friction for objects at high speed, it is not the dominant effect. The exact details of why ice forms a slippery liquid layer, even when little pressure or friction is applied, is currently not completely settled by scientists and is an ongoing area of research. Ice has been found to always have a thin liquid layer on its surface, even at temperature well below freezing, and even in the absence of contact with any objects. The formation of a surface liquid layer is therefore a property of ice itself and not a property of interacting with an object. The liquid layer seems to arise because the water molecules at the surface have fewer chemical bonds than in bulk, so they can better absorb natural vibrations. In a 2005 Physics Today review article, Robert Rosenberg states, \"The periodic structure breaks down [at the surface] and the molecular layers adopt a more amorphous reconstruction in response to the reduced number of chemical bonds holding the surface molecules in place. Atoms in the outermost surface vibrate with a greater amplitude as a function of temperature than atoms in the interior lattice... Surface melting is attributable to the interaction of the vibrational motion of the surface molecules with the interior bulk molecules.\"",

The higher the current through a given element in the array, the higher the voltage drop across that element.\n\nMoreover, the shape of the IV curve can also affect the potential drop across the array. For instance, if the IV curve has a steep slope at a particular voltage range, it means that for a small change in applied voltage, there would be a large change in current flow.

Sub-DLAs also have the appropriate density and column density to shield the accelerated cosmic rays and facilitate their interactions with the gas, producing the observed high-energy phenomena. Therefore, sub-DLAs are valuable targets for studies aiming to understand the origin and behavior of cosmic rays.",

The two others are very distant from these first three, and just appear at the same point in the sky by random chance because they lie on the same line of sight from earth. If viewed from another galaxy, these two other stars would not line up and would not appear to be a part of the main Polaris system. The brightest star of the main system is a supergiant, and the other two stars are smaller and orbit around it. Secondly, none of the stars in the sky really move over the course of a single day. They are all stuck in place. (The stars do have movement, but these movement are measured in millions of years and not days.) The stars seem to all sweep across the sky every night because the earth is rotating. The earth rotates on its axis once a day. As a result, all of the stars in the sky sweep through great arcs and take about a day to return back their original location. The closer a point on the earth is to its axis of rotation; which cuts through the North and South geographic poles; the less that point moves. A person standing exactly on the North pole does not move at all over the course of a day. It's like spinning a basketball on your finger. The points on the basketball that are far from the axis of rotation (the sides) move very quickly. But the point on the axis (where your finger touches) hardly moves at all. That is why you can balance the ball on one finger when it is spinning. And because the daily movement of the stars in the sky is caused by earth's rotation, the closer a star is to the axis of earth's rotation (an imaginary line that extends straight up from the North and South pole, out into space), the slower it moves in the sky. There is nothing special about Polaris beyond the fact that it ended up being the one right now sitting closest to the earth's axis of rotation in the North. Because it is so close to the axis, Polaris moves very little in the sky throughout the night. Thirdly, Polaris is not exactly lined up with earth's axis of rotation. There is very low probability that any star would end up exactly lined up with earth's axis. Polaris lies at a viewing angle that is 0.736 degrees away from exact North. Because the North Star does not lie exactly on earth's rotation axis, it actually arcs through the sky every night. The arc is just so small that humans can't see it. Furthermore, earth's rotation axis is not completely fixed. Because earth is not perfectly spherical but bulges at the equator, the sun's gravitational effects on the earth are not completely symmetrical. This non-symmetry creates a very small and very slow twist on the earth that is turning earth's rotation axis away from Polaris. In about 3000 years, the star named Gamma Cephei will end up much closer to earth's rotation axis than Polaris, and will therefore be the new \"North Star\".",

It can be calculated using various mathematical methods, including statistical thermodynamics and information theory.\n\nOne common approach is based on the so-called Fisher metric, which quantifies the curvature of the thermodynamic potential surface. The Fisher metric can be expressed in terms of the derivatives of the thermodynamic potential, such as the entropy, energy, and free energy, with respect to the state variables such as temperature, pressure, and chemical potential.\n\nTo calculate the thermodynamic length, one needs to specify the initial and final equilibrium states and then integrate the Fisher metric along a path connecting them. This path can be arbitrary, as long as it stays within the manifold of equilibrium states. The resulting thermodynamic length then represents the minimum amount of work needed to transform the system from the initial state to the final state.\n\nNumerical methods can also be used to compute the thermodynamic length, such as Monte Carlo simulations or molecular dynamics simulations, which rely on statistical sampling of the phase space of the system. These methods can provide accurate estimates of the thermodynamic length for complex systems, including biological and soft matter systems.",

        "query": "What makes x so special that you see it all the time in equations?",
        "response": "From a purely mathematical perspective, there is absolutely nothing special about choosing the letter x as your label for a variable. Labels are used in mathematics to represent numbers that are not yet known or can change (variables), a collection of numbers (functions and vectors), and numbers that are known but are too complicated to write out explicitly every time (constants). You can choose to label the unknown thing however you want and still end up with the same answer. Labels need to be used in order to keep track of the mathematical objects. Consider a simple example: I walk into a classroom with three identical cardboard boxes, each containing some unknown item. The items in each box are different. I give the boxes to the students in the room and ask them to try to figure out what each box contains without opening them. The students start weighing the boxes, shaking them, smelling them and so forth. They find that one box contains something heavy. But a few minutes later, the boxes have been handed around and they can't remember if the one that contains something magnetic was also the one that contains something heavy because the boxes all look the same. What do they need? labels! With a pencil, the students mark one box \"A\", another box \"B\", and the last box \"C\". Now they can keep track of which properties belong to which box. It doesn't matter which box they decide to call \"A\". In fact, from a mathematical perspective, it doesn't matter what they call each box. They could have labeled the boxes \"1\", \"2\", and \"3\" or \"red\", \"green\", \"blue\", or even \"Freddy\", \"Sally\", and \"Joe\", and the labels would still have served their purpose of keeping the boxes differentiated until their contents can be known. While there is total mathematical freedom in choosing label names, there is still some human advantage to wisely choosing the names. For instance, what if the students labeled the boxes \"Michael Jordan\", \"Micheal Jackson,\" and \"the moon\". Observations such as \"Micheal Jordan is heavy but Micheal Jackson is light\", \"the moon sounds like it contains powder\" , and \"Michael Jordan seems more magnetic than the moon\" are confusing. The problem is that these words already have meanings on their own. In contrast, letters of the alphabet are vague enough entities that they can be used as labels without creating confusion. The best labels for the boxes are probably \"A\", \"B\", and \"C\". The same is true in mathematics. The equation \"red = blue2\" is a perfectly valid mathematical equation if \"red\" simply labels the area of a square and \"blue\" labels the length of the square. But to humans, this equation looks confusing because these words have meanings beyond how they are being used as labels. The best labels are the ones that have as little meaning as possible on their own. Good labels for variables in mathematics are therefore the letters of the alphabet. Even better are the letters that get used the least in everyday English: x, y, and z. I believe these letters are used so often as variable names in mathematics because they are used so little in conversational English. To further reduce confusion, certain traditions have arisen with regards to assigning labels. Following these traditions makes the equations easier to read, but does not make their mathematical content any different. People who use non-traditional labels may still get the same answers in the end, but they will confuse a lot of people along the way (perhaps including themselves). Below are the traditions for mathematical labels. I suggest you follow these whenever doing mathematics. In general, letters from the beginning of the alphabets are used for constants, letters from the middle of the alphabet are used for functions, and letters from the end of the alphabet are used for variables. Labeling traditions to follow in mathematics: Labels to avoid in mathematics: What if you need to keep track of many time variables? There is only one traditional label for time: t. The solution is to use primes or subscript letters. For example, one reference frame follows time t, while another follows time t \u2018, and still another follows time t \". Or the time on earth can be tracked with the label tE and the time on the moon can be tracked with the label tM. In general, multiple variables that are very similar should be handled in this way using primes or subscript letters. On the other hand, multiple constants should be differentiated by subscript numbers. For instance, use t0, t1, t2, t3... to keep track of multiple points in time. If you are curious, here are the traditional labels for various physical properties. Traditional labels for physical properties:",

        "response": "Yes, wind can travel faster than the speed of sound. Wind is just the bulk movement of a mass of air through space and is in principle no different from a train speeding along or a comet zipping through space. The only limitation on the bulk motion of objects with mass is the universal speed limit of the speed of light in vacuum. The speed of sound is not a fundamental speed like the speed of light is. The speed of sound just describes how fast a mechanical wave travels through a material. Different materials have different speeds of sound. Wind speed and the speed of sound are completely different things. Wind speed is the speed of a chunk of air moving relative to a stationary, external observer. Wind speed is therefore frame dependent. On the other hand, the speed of sound is the speed of a vibrational wave inside a material relative to that material, and is therefore not frame dependent. If you pick your frame of reference right, you can get wind traveling at nearly the speed of light. For instance, air in your living room that is stationary with respect to you and the earth is also wind traveling at incredible speed relative to the center of our galaxy. Air on the International Space Station is traveling about 20 times the speed of sound relative to earth, and yet the astronauts in the space station can talk just fine and send sound back and forth through this air. With that said, large gusts of wind on earth's surface do not typically travel anywhere near as fast as sound. So what would happen if wind traveled faster than the speed of sound? In isolation, not much. Wind traveling faster than the speed of sound in isolation is still just wind. But, if that supersonic wind hits a stationary object, it will create a sonic boom and knock that object forcefully. A jet flying faster than the speed of sound through stationary air is identical to wind blowing faster than the speed of sound past a stationary jet. In both cases, the same sonic boom is created. In fact, this equivalence is the operating principle behind wind tunnels. Wind going faster than the speed of sound and hitting stationary trees, houses, and rocks would create sonic booms. Note that if there really were large, sustained, weather-caused winds that were going faster than the speed of sound relative to the ground, you would have a lot more to worry about than the sound of the sonic booms. The speed of sound in air is about 750 miles per hour (340 m/s). Sustained wind speeds above 60 miles per hour are enough to uproot trees, knock down buildings, and throw cars around.",

        "response": "Quantum theory does not allow a rock to turn suddenly into a duck. It does not allow any other bizarre transformation to happen either. This idea is a myth perpetuated by people who misunderstand quantum theory. Foundational to quantum theory is the concept of particle uncertainty. It is impossible to know a particle's exact location and exact momentum at the same time. Furthermore, a quantum particle's exact location and exact momentum does not even exist at the same time. The uncertainty in quantum theory is not a result of measurement limitations but is inherent to each quantum object itself. The more you try to trap a single electron and therefore force it to have a more defined position, the less defined becomes its momentum. This uncertainty means that quantum particles can end up in unexpected places. The more unexpected its destination, the less likely it is to end up there, but the probability is never zero. The line or reasoning goes that because a rock is made out of quantum particles (electrons, protons, and neutrons), and because quantum particles can do unexpected things on account of the uncertainty principle, then a rock can do unexpected things like turn suddenly into a duck. According to this line of reasoning, the probability of a rock turning into a duck is very low, so that it almost never happens, but it is physically possible and so it will happen if we wait long enough. This line of reasoning is wrong. It goes wrong in applying the uncertainty principle to large-scale objects. The uncertainty principle applies only to individual quantum objects and small collections of quantum objects. When trillions of quantum objects are involved, the uncertainty goes completely away. The behavior of a trillion atoms is not just the behavior of one atom times a trillion. The reason for this is that the atoms are interacting with each other. As a loose analogy, the behavior of 10 kids at one birthday party is very different from the summed behavior of 10 kids, each alone at 10 different birthday parties. Even the smallest objects visible to human eyes, such as a grain of sand, have trillions upon trillions of atoms. Human-sized objects therefore have no uncertainty and will never do anything bizarre no matter how long you wait. Quantum theory is fundamentally statistical. This means that there is always uncertainty for a single particle, but for a statistically-significant collection of particles, the system predictably obeys the equations of quantum theory. Quantum uncertainty is not a magic ticket that allows you to break all other laws of physics. The conservation laws are fundamental, universal laws of physics that hold everywhere and cannot be broken. The conservation of mass/energy states that matter/energy cannot be created or destroyed but only transformed from one state into another. The conservation of momentum states that the total momentum of a system is constant. Momentum can not be created or destroyed. If a tiny pebble suddenly transformed into a large duck, it would definitely break the law of conservation of mass/energy as matter would have been created out of nothing. If a rock sitting motionless suddenly shot in the air with no external force applied, it would break the law of conservation of momentum as momentum would have been created out of nothing. The conservation laws of physics and the statistical nature of quantum theory keep the universe ticking forward in a very predictable way despite the uncertainty present in single particles. A rock will never turn into a duck no matter how long you wait.",
