This coupling leads to the formation of two coupled modes, namely the amide I mode (C=O stretch) and amide II mode (N-H bend). \n\nIn addition, NMA also exhibits a Fermi resonance between the amide I mode and the overtone of the bending mode, which leads to a splitting of the amide I band into two sub-bands. This splitting is further complicated by the fact that NMA is a flexible molecule that can adopt different conformations, each with a slightly different intramolecular hydrogen bonding pattern.\n\nOverall, the vibrational interaction in NMA is highly complex, and the interpretation of its infrared spectrum requires advanced spectroscopic techniques and theoretical models.",

        "response": "Cell phones do not cause cancer, no matter how long they are used, because they communicate using radio waves. Radio waves simply don't have enough energy per photon to ionize atoms. The World Health Organization states, \"Only the high frequency portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, which includes X rays and gamma rays, is ionizing\". Cancer occurs when the DNA in a cell is altered so that the cell grows in an uncontrolled way. DNA can be altered in many ways, but when it comes to cancer due to radiation exposure, an electron must be knocked off a molecule by a bit of radiation. The smallest possible bit of electromagnetic radiation is known as a photon. Electrons are bound to molecules, so it takes a certain minimum energy to knock off the electron. Light with frequencies above ultraviolet (x-rays and gamma rays) are known as ionizing radiation because each photon has enough energy to knock an electron off a molecule. Photons of light with frequencies at and below ultraviolet (radio waves, microwaves, infrared, red, orange, yellow, blue, violet) are non-ionizing. They simply don't have enough energy to remove an electron and cause cancer. Increasing the strength of a radio wave will not help it knock off electrons. Increasing the strength of a radio wave simply introduces more photons into the beam. But each radio photon still has the same energy it always does, which is not enough to ionize. When non-ionizing waves flow past a molecule, they shake up the electrons a bit but don't knock them off. This electron shaking leads to heating. A microwave oven heats up your food in the same way a campfire heats up your skin and in the same way a radio wave ever-so-slightly heats up your body. None of them causes cancer, no matter how long you sit there. You may get burned by sticking your hand in the fire or grabbing a hot dish right out of the microwave, but you won't get a tumor. If a radio wave did cause cancer, then candlelight would cause far more cancer, because visible light has far more energy per photon. In terms of radiation, a candle emits far more energy than a cell phone, and they are both harmless. Infrared waves have more energy per photon than radio waves, and everything with a non-zero temperature emits infrared waves. This means that the infrared waves coming from your chair, your pencil, and your clothes would give you cancer long before radio waves from your cell phone would, but they don't. The world is swamped with natural radio waves and infrared waves. Just ask any infrared camera designer what his main obstacle is in designing a camera and he will tell you his greatest challenge is separating the meaningful waves from all the background waves in the air. Anybody who has struggled with an old-fashioned analog TV antenna in an attempt to get a clear picture can tell you that the natural radio waves in the air can be quite overwhelming compared to the man-made ones. People who are worried about being bombarded with radio waves in our increasingly wireless world must realize that the sun and the rocks have been bombarding mankind with infrared and radio waves long before radio broadcast stations and WIFI routers came along. There are electromagnetic waves with high enough frequency to damage molecules: x-rays and gamma rays. That's why if you get too many x-ray scans taken you will get cancer. In addition, alpha, beta and neutron radiation can cause cancer, but they are only created by nuclear reactions, and not by cell phones. Any machine that produces x-rays is known to be dangerous and is heavily regulated in order to ensure safe use.",

        "query": "Can a man's testosterone be boosted naturally?",
        "response": "Yes, but probably not in the way you are thinking, and only if the man has a healthy testosterone hormone system to begin with. Testosterone is an important hormone that plays many roles. In adult males, testosterone promotes muscle growth, physical energy, assertive and competitive moods, sperm development, libido, and emotional bonding. A man with abnormally low testosterone therefore experiences low energy, muscle weakening, mood problems, infertility, low libido, and emotional distance. In contrast, a man with a significantly higher-than-normal testosterone level can enjoy high energy, strong muscles, constructive moods, increased libido, and emotional closeness. For these reasons, boosting testosterone is generally desirable. However, if the testosterone level is too high, it can cause liver damage, uncontrollable moods, and cardiovascular disease. The ideal level of testosterone is therefore in the high end of the normal range. Fortunately, a man can only get dangerously high levels of testosterone if he dopes or if he has a rare disease. Testosterone doping, which involves internally taking in testosterone from an external source without medical necessity, is inherently dangerous and unhealthy because it raises testosterone levels too high. Testosterone doping is therefore illegal. As long as you don't resort to illegal drugs, any action that boosts your testosterone will elevate your levels while keeping you safely in the normal range, thereby allowing you to enjoy the benefits without the risks.  Let's look at various agents and actions that do and do not boost testosterone. Keep in mind that all of the concepts below assume that the man has a healthy testosterone hormone system, which includes a properly functioning hypothalamus, pituitary gland, and testicles. If a man has a non-functioning testosterone hormone pathway, no amount of effort will naturally boost his testosterone levels. Such a man has to undergo hormone replacement therapy in order to have normal health. Also note that testosterone is a hormone with a long-term action. This means that a higher testosterone level will only lead to higher energy, bigger muscles, and better moods if the testosterone levels remain consistently elevated for several weeks to months. Agents that may lead to a temporary elevation of testosterone followed by a dip have no effect on long-term testosterone levels and therefore do not give the desired long-term benefits. Testosterone precursor pills do not boost long-term testosterone levels.\r\nTestosterone precursor pills are commonly sold on the shelves of pharmacies and convenience stores, and are marketed as performance enhancing drugs, but the truth is that they don't work. Chemicals such as DHEA, androstenedione, and androstenediol are indeed used by your body to manufacture testosterone. But just because you have elevated amounts of androstenedione in your blood does not mean that your body will automatically convert it all into elevated amounts of testosterone. In fact, your body will convert almost none of the surplus precursor. If testosterone precursor pills actually worked like testosterone doping does, they would be pulled off the shelves and be made just as illegal as testosterone doping. A review article in the Journal of Athletic Training written by Michael E. Powers presents numerous studies which found that taking testosterone precursor pills does not increase long-term testosterone levels. Researchers found that excessive testosterone precursors in the male body are converted to estrogen and not testosterone. Therefore, taking DHEA pills, androstenedione pills, or androstenediol pills leads to elevated estrogen in males, not testosterone. Powers states, As mentioned previously, ergogenic claims are based on the theory that precursor ingestion will result in increased testosterone levels, which would then stimulate an increase in muscle protein synthesis. However, at this time, there is no scientific support for this theory, as both DHEA and A'dione ingestion have failed to increase protein synthesis in groups of young men. Furthermore, 8 weeks of A'dione supplementation (300 mg/d) and resistance training failed to increase muscle-fiber cross-sectional area when compared with placebo ingestion and training. Sexual activity does not boost long-term testosterone levels.\r\nWhile sexual activity, whether visual or physical, does indeed raise testosterone levels for a few hours after the activity, it has no effect on long-term testosterone levels. Therefore sexual activity does not lead to long-term testosterone-induced health benefits such as increased muscle mass or heightened physical energy. In fact, a study by Helena C. Kraemer and her collaborators found that, \"Mean testosterone levels were higher for sexually less active individuals.\"\r\n Exercise does boost long-term testosterone levels.\r\nConsistent exercise has been found to indeed raise long-term testosterone levels. This makes sense since two major roles of testosterone are to build up muscle tissue and to provide higher energy levels, both of which are used when exercising. High-intensity workouts have traditionally been thought to increase testosterone more than moderate-intensity workouts. However, research has found that although this may be true for the hour after the workout, there is no long-term difference in testosterone levels between a man pursuing high-intensity exercise and a man pursuing moderate-intensity exercise, all else being equal. For example, a study by Truls Raastad and his collaborators published in the European Journal of Applied Physiology states, \"In conclusion, moderate- and high-intensity strength exercise did not differ with respect to prolonged (1-33 h) hormonal responses.\"\r\n Adequate sleep does boost long-term testosterone levels.\r\nJust like many other hormones, the release of testosterone follows a daily pattern of highs and lows that is regulated to some extent by the sleep cycle. Therefore, ongoing inadequate sleep, interrupted sleep, and irregular sleep all interfere with the release cycle and lead to lower testosterone levels. While developing good sleep habits will not boost testosterone much beyond the average healthy value, it will keep it from dipping below this value. A research letter by Rachel Leproult and Eve Van Cauter, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, states, \"Daytime testosterone levels were decreased by 10% to 15% in this small convenience sample of young healthy men who underwent 1 week of sleep restriction to 5 hours per night...\" Losing weight and eating a healthy diet does boost long-term testosterone levels.\r\nIn addition to a host of other health benefits, losing excess body weight and eating a nutritious, balanced diet indeed increases long-term testosterone levels. Eating too much sugar has been found to reduce testosterone levels, as has obesity in general. A review article by Giovanni Corona and his collaborators, published in the European Journal of Endocrinology, presents their compilation of the results of 24 research studies. The review article concludes that, \"Overall, both a low-calorie diet and bariatric surgery are associated with a significant (P<0.0001) increase in plasma sex hormone-binding globulin-bound and -unbound testosterone levels (total testosterone (TT)), with bariatric surgery being more effective in comparison with the low-calorie diet...Androgen rise is greater in those patients who lose more weight...\" Reducing stress does boost long-term testosterone levels.\r\nOngoing psychological stress has been found to lower testosterone levels. Ongoing stress induces the body to release elevated amounts of the stress hormone cortisol, which signals to the body to make changes allowing it to better cope with the stress. One of these changes is the reduction of testosterone. The body makes this change so that energy and attention can be devoted to surviving the stress instead of building up body mass and enabling reproduction. Therefore, reducing the level of ongoing stress in a man's life can boost long-term testosterone levels. Note that over-exercising is a type of stress. Taking vitamin D supplements and zinc supplements can boost long-term testosterone levels.\r\nFor those who aren't getting enough vitamin D or zinc, returning the amounts of these nutrients in the body to normal levels can indeed increase long-term testosterone levels. A study by Stefan Pilz and his collaborators, as published in the journal Hormone and Metabolic Research states, \"In overweight men with deficient vitamin D status a significant increase in testosterone was observed after intake of 83 \u03bcg vitamin D daily for 1 year whereas there was no significant change in men receiving placebo.\"",

As massive objects spiral in towards the center of the galaxy, they can eventually become part of the central bulge or contribute to the growth of the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy. \n\nDynamical friction also plays a role in the evolution of galactic clusters, where the frictional forces between individual galaxies can cause them to merge and form larger galaxies over time.

        "response": "Yes, sound waves can generate heat. In fact, sound waves almost always generate a little bit of heat as they travel and almost always end up as heat when they are absorbed. Sound and heat are both macroscopic descriptions of the movement of atoms and molecules. Sound is the ordered movement of atoms and molecules in rapid waving patterns. Heat is the disordered, random, movement of atoms and molecules. Therefore, all you have to do in order to turn sound into heat is transform some of the ordered movement of the atoms and molecules into disordered movement. This effect always happens to some extent. This effect happens a lot whenever the sound wave encounters irregularities as it travels. For instance, dust particles in air are irregularities that randomly interfere with the vibrating motion of some of the air molecules that make up the sound wave. The dust particles mess up some of the ordered motion, and therefore convert some of the sound to heat. As another example, the rough surface of an object constitutes a collection of irregularities that the sound wave encounters. Therefore, when a sound wave hits a rough surface, the motion of the air molecules gets scrambled up a bit. Note that the air molecules already have a motion that is somewhat disordered. In other words, air through which sound is traveling already contains some amount of heat. When some of the sound wave is converted to heat, the motion of the air molecules becomes more disordered and the amount of heat increases. The ordered movement of atoms is also made more disorderly when sound travels through acoustically absorbent materials. Materials can be made absorbent by embedding an array of little irregularities directly into the material, such as air bubbles. For this reason, materials that are soft and porous, like cloth, are good at converting sound to heat. The sound is said to be \"absorbed\" or \"lost\" when it is converted to heat inside a material. Even without irregularities, a material can be highly absorbent if the atoms and molecules that make up the material cannot slide past each other smoothly. In this case, an atom or molecule that is trying to participate in the ordered vibrational motion of the sound wave roughly slides past the neighboring atoms or molecules that are off to the side, such that motion gets diverted in sideways directions rather than continuing in the forward direction as part of the sound wave. The ordered motion therefore becomes disordered. You can think of it as a kind of internal friction that all materials posses to some extent. In this way, some of the sound energy is converted to thermal energy. All materials, even air, have some amount of resistance to smooth atomic/molecular sliding and therefore are somewhat absorbent to sound. In summary, sound waves always generate a little heat as they travel and they ultimately almost always end up completely as heat when they are absorbed by materials. However, the amount of energy carried by sound waves is very small, so that the amount of heat they generate is typically insignificant. In short, cranking up the volume on your speakers is a terrible way to try to heat up your room. Yelling at your soup does indeed warm it up, but the amount is far too small to be noticeable.",

This radiation exerts a strong pressure on the surrounding gas, causing it to be expelled from the system in the form of a high-speed jet. \n\nThe process of jet coupling occurs because the outflowing material carries a significant amount of angular momentum, which is conserved as it moves away from the black hole. This causes the jet to be aligned with the rotation axis of the black hole, which in turn can be used to probe its spin.

If the acceleration is small enough, the inertial force my not be noticeable. But all practical vehicles have high enough accelerations for their inertial forces to be felt. The fact that acceleration always causes inertial forces is universal and fundamental. There is no way to use technology to cancel out inertial forces.

The critical behavior can be characterized by certain critical exponents, which describe how various properties of the system change close to the critical point.\n\nTo determine the universality of the lattice model, we need to compare its critical exponents to those of other models in the same universality class. A universality class refers to a group of models that share the same critical behavior, despite having different details in their microscopic interactions.\n\nOne way to do this is by using renormalization group techniques, which involve systematically removing short-length-scale fluctuations from the system and analyzing the resulting effective theory. This allows us to determine the relevant scaling laws and critical exponents for the system, which can then be compared to those of other models.\n\nAnother approach is to use numerical simulations to calculate the critical exponents directly. By varying system parameters and measuring observables such as the correlation length or susceptibility, we can obtain estimates for the critical exponents and compare them to those of other models.\n\nIf the critical exponents of the lattice model are found to match those of other models in the same universality class, then we can conclude that the lattice model is also in that universality class and exhibits the same critical behavior.",

In general, the metallicity gradient becomes shallower over time due to the mixing of metals throughout the galaxy. This is because as stars are born and die, they release heavy elements (metals) into the surrounding gas, enriching it with more metals over time.\n\nHowever, the metallicity gradient can also be influenced by external factors such as accretion events and mergers with other galaxies. For example, if a galaxy has a significant accretion event or undergoes a merger with another gas-rich galaxy, it could lead to a sudden increase in metallicity in parts of the galaxy, perhaps even flattening the metallicity gradient temporarily.\n\nOverall, while the general trend is towards a shallower metallicity gradient over time, the exact trajectory depends on the specific history and environment of the galaxy.",

This is due to the interference that occurs between the different paths that the walker can take simultaneously.\n\nIn particular, when the walker is in a superposition of states, it can take multiple paths at the same time, leading to constructive or destructive interference. In some cases, this interference can cause the probability of the walker returning to the starting point to be much higher than 1/N, and the walker will continue to recur there periodically.

So we have:\n\n(x+1)^3 = x^3 + 3x^2 + 3x + 1 = x^3 + x^2 + x + 1\n\nThis means that the 3-potent elements in Z[x] are precisely the elements of the form a = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + a_3x^3, where a_i = 0 or 1 for each i.\n\nSimilarly, in the algebra of 2x2 matrices over the field F, an element A is 2-potent if A^2 = A.

Conditional skewness refers to the distribution of residuals (the differences between the observed values and predicted values) being symmetric and centered around zero, and the assumption of this symmetry allows statistical models to make accurate predictions and inferences about the population parameters.\n\nIf the conditional skewness assumption is violated, then statistical models and tests may produce biased or incorrect results, leading to misleading conclusions and decisions based on the data. Therefore, it is important to check and ensure that the conditional skewness assumption is met before making any statistical inferences or conclusions based on the data.",

In general, however, nonlinear nonequilibrium systems tend to exhibit more complex dynamics and behaviors than linear or equilibrium systems, which can lead to changes in entropy.\n\nOne possible explanation for why entropy changes in nonlinear nonequilibrium regimes is that these systems are often driven away from equilibrium by external inputs or fluctuations. This can lead to the generation of new structures and patterns within the system, which can increase or decrease the entropy depending on the nature of these patterns. For example, the formation of stable, ordered structures within a system can decrease its entropy, while the formation of chaotic, unpredictable patterns can increase it.\n\nOverall, the relationship between entropy and nonlinear nonequilibrium systems is complex and highly dependent on the specific details of the system and its dynamics.

A point in outer space is filled with gas, dust, a wind of charged particles from the stars, light from stars, cosmic rays, radiation left over from the Big Bang, gravity, electric and magnetic fields, and neutrinos from nuclear reactions. As the book \"Nothingness: The Science of Empty Space\" by Dr. Henning Genz describes, space is also filled with two things we can't directly detect: dark matter and dark energy. Even if all these things could be removed and blocked out from a certain region of space, there would still be three things we could never remove according to Dr. Genz: (1) vacuum energy, (2) the Higgs field, and (3) spacetime curvature. Vacuum energy (also called vacuum fluctuations or zero-point energy) is a sea of particles and antiparticles flashing briefly into and out of existence. Vacuum energy has a very real effect because it weakens, or screens, electric fields. Vacuum fluctuations are not some exotic, untested, theoretical artifact. Rather, vacuum fluctuations are fundamental to many everyday phenomena. Lasers, like the one in your DVD machine, crucially depend on the existence of vacuum fluctuations. A laser beam is created when you set up a material properly so that you get a chain reaction of coherent light emissions. This chain reaction is started by vacuum fluctuations. Likewise, radioactive decay, such as experienced in the carbon-14 that archeologists use to date materials, is initiated by vacuum fluctuations. Vacuum energy can be measured through the Casimir effect: two uncharged metallic spheres are brought very close together and the vacuum energy causes them to be attracted. When their separation is small enough, the attraction due to vacuum energy dominates over gravitational and electromagnetic effects. Vacuum energy also accounts for the Lamb shift in hydrogen energy levels. Vacuum energy is an established principle of mainstream physics. (On the other hand, harnessing vacuum fluctuations as a free source of industrial energy is pseudo-science.) Next, the Higgs field exists everywhere and is what gives many particles their mass. Due to the conservation of mass-energy, mass-energy cannot be created or destroyed in a closed system. As a result, when the Higgs field gives mass to a particle, it does so by taking energy out of the vacuum. The Higgs field made big news in 2012 when the first significant experimental verification of its existence was announced at the Large Hadron Collider in CERN. Lastly, spacetime curvature is an innate property of space itself, according to Einstein's General Theory of Relativity. Masses act on space by giving it curvature, and space acts back on masses by having them travel in its curved shape. The phenomenon of masses traveling in straight lines in a curved spacetime is known as gravity. The curved trajectory of a satellite in orbit is really a straight line in a curved space. A space devoid of masses still has a shape (it still has Einstein's metric field). That shape can even be curved, even without any masses, according to the equations. There is no way to suck gravity or block gravity out of a region of space because gravity is just the shape of space itself. As a result, even the most empty of physical vacuums will always have a curvature field. Perfectly \"empty\" space will always have vacuum energy, the Higgs field, and spacetime curvature. More typical vacuums, such as in outer space, also have gas, dust, wind, light, electric fields, magnetic fields, cosmic rays, neutrinos, dark matter, and dark energy. Despite all these things zipping around in outer space, space does seem empty to earth-bound humans who are used to a dense layer of air to swim around in.\r\nThese concepts are summarized in the list below.

        "response": "Warm water generally gets more dense as it gets colder, and therefore sinks. This fact may lead you to believe that ice should form on the bottom of a lake first. But a funny thing happens to water as it gets even colder. Colder than 4\u00b0 Celsius (39\u00b0 Fahrenheit), water begins expanding and becomes less dense as it gets colder. As a result, close to freezing, colder water floats to the top and the warmer water sinks to the bottom. The density of water as a function of temperature can be seen in the plot on the right. Eventually, the coldest water, which has floated to the top of the lake in wintry conditions, freezes to form a layer of ice. Right when the water freezes to ice, the ice becomes significantly less dense than the water and continues to float on the lake's surface. Ice is less dense than water because of the way it forms a hexagonal crystalline structure. Each water molecule consists of two hydrogen atoms bonded to the bottom of an oxygen atom. When ice forms, the hydrogen atoms of one water molecule form weak hydrogen bonds with the top of the oxygen atoms of two other water molecules. Lining up the water molecules in this pattern takes up more space than having them jumbled randomly together (as is the case in liquid water). And because the same mass of molecules takes up more space when frozen, ice is less dense than liquid water. For this same reason, water below 4\u00b0 Celsius becomes increasingly less dense as it gets colder. Close to freezing temperatures, the molecules in the liquid water begin to line up into the space-filling hexagonal structure. The textbook River and Lake Ice Engineering by George D. Ashton states, \"As a lake cools from above 4\u00b0 C, the surface water loses heat, becomes more dense and sinks. This process continues until all the water in the lake is at 4\u00b0 C, when the density of water is at its maximum. With further cooling (and without mechanical mixing) a stable, lighter layer of water forms at the surface. As this layer cools to its freezing point, ice begins to form on the surface of the lake.\" In deep lakes, water pressure may also play a role. The gravitational weight of all the water higher up in the lake presses down on the water deep in the lake. The pressure allows the water near the bottom of the lake to get cold without expanding and rising. Because of the pressure, the water at the bottom of deep lakes can become cold without freezing to ice.",

This theorem states that if a system at local equilibrium is driven out of equilibrium by the application of a small external perturbation, the probability of observing an entropy change \u0394S that is inconsistent with the second law of thermodynamics can be quantified using a mathematical expression known as the Crooks fluctuation theorem.\n\nThe Crooks fluctuation theorem states that the probability distribution of observing an entropy change \u0394S in a small system undergoing transitions between two states separated by a finite change of an external parameter, is related to the probability distribution of observing the reverse entropy change -\u0394S under time-reversal by the equation:\n\nP[\u0394S]/P[-\u0394S] = exp(\u0394S/kB)\n\nwhere P[\u0394S] is the probability of observing a particular entropy change \u0394S, P[-\u0394S] is the probability of observing the reverse entropy change -\u0394S, and kB is the Boltzmann constant.

        "query": "What is the shape of an electron?",
        "response": "Depending on how you define \"shape\", an electron either has no shape, or an electron can take on various wave shapes. The shape of an electron is never statically round like an orange. The reason for this is that an electron is not a solid little ball, despite being so often portrayed this way in the popular media and in elementary-level science texts. Rather, electrons are quantum objects. Along with all other quantum objects, an electron is partly a wave and partly a particle. To be more accurate, an electron is neither literally a traditional wave nor a traditional particle, but is instead a quantized fluctuating probability wavefunction. This wavefunction looks in certain ways like a wave and in other ways like a particle. An electron looks like a particle when it interacts with other objects in certain ways (such as in high-speed collisions). When an electron looks more like a particle it has no shape, according to the Standard Model. In this context, physicists call an electron a \"point particle,\" meaning that it interacts as if it is entirely located at a single point in space and does not spread out to fill a three-dimensional volume. If you find the concept of a fixed amount of mass being contained in the infinitely small volume of a single point illogical, then you should. But you have to realize that the electron is not literally a solid ball. This means that the electron's mass is not literally squeezed into an infinitely small volume. Rather, in certain cases where the electron looks somewhat like a particle, it interacts as if it were completely located at a single point. Therefore, in the sense of particle-like interactions, an electron has no shape. Note that an electron is a fundamental particle; it is not made out of anything else (according to our current experiments and theories). All fundamental particles interact as shapeless points when acting like particles. But not all quantum objects are fundamental, and therefore not all quantum objects are point particles. The proton, for instance, is not fundamental, but is instead composed of three quarks. The existence of particles inside a proton means that a proton must spread out to fill a certain space and have a certain shape. A proton is not a point particle, but is in fact a sphere with a radius of 8.8 \u00d7 10-16 meters. (Note that as a quantum object, a proton is not a solid sphere with a hard surface, but is really a quantized wave function that interacts in particle-like collisions as if it were a cloud-like sphere.) If the electron was composed of other particles, it could indeed have a shape when interacting like a particle. But it doesn't. The electron is a point particle. When an electron is behaving more like a wave, it can have all sorts of shapes, as long as its shape obeys the electron wave equation. An electron's wave equation, and therefore its shape, is a function of its energy and the shape of the potential well trapping it. For instance, when an electron is bound in a simple hydrogen atom, an electron can take on the familiar orbitals taught in elementary physics and chemistry classes, such as the shape shown on the right. In fact, the word \"orbital\" in this context really just means \"the shape of an electron when acting as a wave bound in an atom\". Each atomic orbital is not some mathematical average of where the electron has been, or some average forecast of where the electron may be. Each orbital is the electron, spread out in the quantum wavefunction state. In the sense of its wave-like state, an electron in a hydrogen atom can have the shape of layered spheres (the \"s\" states), layered dumbbells (the \"p\" states), layered four-leaf clovers (the \"d\" states), and other shapes at higher energies. In other atoms and molecules, an electron can take on even more complex shapes. An electron can also be trapped by other objects besides atoms. For instance, electrons trapped in the potential wells of a quantum cascade laser take on shapes that look more like traditional waves. An example of electron wavefunction shapes in a quantum cascade laser is shown on the right. Note that when scientists or journalists say \"the shape of an electron is round,\" they are not talking about the literal shape. They are talking about the electric field distribution created by a free electron, which is entirely different from the actual shape.",

        "response": "This question is rather subjective and depends on what you mean by \"harmful\". If you mean to ask which pseudo-science concept leads to the most bodily harm to humans, then the winner is definitely vaccine denialism. The safety and effectiveness of vaccines in protecting humans against specific diseases is one of the most experimentally-verified concepts of all time. Believing that the moon landings were faked may make you out of touch with reality, but this belief does not really harm anyone. In contrast, avoiding vaccines ultimately leads to disease and death. Furthermore, avoiding vaccines not only harms you, it harms your entire community because you spread dangerous contagions once infected. This fact is what makes vaccine denialism so insidious. No matter how trendy, popular, \"natural\", and attractive vaccine avoidance is made to appear, it does not change the scientific fact that vaccines save lives in a measurable, understandable, direct manner; and that vaccine denialism leads to disease, suffering, and death. Among all the different kinds of pseudo-science, vaccine denialism stands alone in a separate category because of the ability of viruses and bacteria to spread and mutate. Let's look at what makes vaccine denialism stand in a league of its own among the pseudo-science concepts. 1. Vaccine denialism leads the denialist to fail to protect himself from serious diseases. \r\nBelieving that free energy devices actually work will lead you to waste a few dollars on a useless electric gizmo but will not do much else. Using a magnetic health bracelet may not improve your blood flow, but it also won't hurt you. Believing that distant stars uniquely affect your personal relationships may cause you to make poor relationship decisions, but the belief won't cause you bodily harm. Believing that aliens from another planet have landed their UFO's on earth may lead to some awkward conversations at social events, but it won't cause anybody to get sick or injured. In contrast, avoiding vaccines ultimately leads to increased infection and bodily damage. Often when educated people meet a friend who believes in some form of pseudo-science, our response is to roll our eyes and change the subject, mumbling to ourselves, \"Whatever. He is free to believe this nonsense. It doesn't hurt anyone.\" But when it comes to vaccine denialism, it does hurt people. Educated people therefore have a moral obligation to speak up against vaccine denialism. Note that we should make a distinction between unknown science and pseudo-science. An instance of unknown science is a certain claim that has no experimental evidence supporting it but also no experimental evidence disproving it. For instance, scientists don't actually know what exists at the center of a black hole. Therefore, even though the belief that black holes contain ice cores may ultimately turn out to be incorrect, it is a perfectly reasonable and rational belief since there is no experimental evidence to disprove it. Such is the nature of unknown science. In contrast, an instance of pseudo-science is a certain claim that has ample experimental evidence disproving it. Belief in pseudo-science is therefore irrational since it requires the denial of physical reality. Vaccine denialism is the ultimate example of pseudo-science, since there is an unparalleled amount of evidence proving that vaccines are generally safe and effective. Every time one person receives a vaccine and is thereby protected from disease, that person becomes one more successful repetition of the vaccine experiment. Since billions of people have been vaccinated and protected over the last two hundred years, the effectiveness of vaccines is one of the most experimentally-verified concepts of all time. 2. Vaccine denialism is indisputably harmful.\r\nHistorical records spanning back 200 years, such as reported in the Social History of Medicine journal, make it clear that every time a community of people avoids vaccines, outbreaks of preventable diseases occur. We are not talking about winter colds here. We are talking about serious diseases such as measles and polio; diseases which can cause death and permanent disability. In 1980, before widespread vaccination, measles killed 2.6 million people a year globally according to the World Health Organization. In contrast, after years of widespread vaccination, measles killed 146 thousand people globally in 2013. Most of these deaths did not occur in regions of the world with high vaccination rates. For instance, the United States experienced zero deaths due to measles in the first eight months of 2013. Vaccine denialism leading to outbreaks of preventable disease is nothing new. Historical records show this phenomenon occurring repeatedly, stretching back over a hundred years. Sadly, some people fail to learn from history, have no knowledge of history, or actively deny history. Vaccines are in an entirely different political category from the category that economic and social issues belong to. Whether a national tax break should be passed is a difficult question. The answer to this question depends on whether the majority of citizens value high personal incomes more, or whether they value government services more. Furthermore, there is no hard scientific evidence identifying one option as better. In this way, political debates about economic and social issues are largely driven by ideology, personal opinion, and political party tribalism. In contrast, there is indisputable scientific evidence that vaccines prevent serious harm. Therefore, there is not really a valid political debate about vaccines, since the evidence is all on one side. Politicians who promote vaccine denialism are not furthering a rational debate, since science settled this question long ago. Such politicians are instead displaying either scientific illiteracy or an intentional denial of reality. In either case, such politicians are not fit for office since vaccine denialism causes so much harm. When a person inserts vaccine denialism into a political discussion, you can be sure that rational discussion has ended and blind ideology has begun. 3. Vaccine denialism harms multiple people and not just the vaccine denialist.\r\nViral and bacterial infections are contagious. A person who becomes infected with a preventable contagious disease becomes a host from which the disease can be spread to others. As infected people sit at school, chat at work, ride the subway, attend sports events, grab snacks at shops, and enjoy rides at amusement parks, they are spreading contagions everywhere they go and endangering everyone they come close to. A vaccine denialist with measles will spread measles to the other vaccine denialists in his neighborhood, since they are similarly unprotected. Furthermore, he will also spread measles to the general public. How is this possible if vaccines are effective? There are four different mechanisms that make this possible. First, no vaccine is 100% effective. Most vaccines are typically 80% to 99% effective, meaning that if 100 people get vaccinated, only 80 to 99 of those people are actually protected. Therefore, infected vaccine denialists will spread the disease to the 1% to 19% of the vaccinated population that is not effectively protected by their vaccinations. Second, viruses and bacteria that are thriving in an infected host have a chance to mutate. If they mutate enough they will not be stopped by vaccinations. If sufficient mutation occurs, the infected vaccine denialist puts 100% of the vaccinated population at risk. Third, young babies are not yet physically ready to receive all of their vaccinations. Even if the baby belongs to a pro-vaccination family, simply the state of being too young for full vaccination makes the baby potentially unprotected to the disease being spread by the infected vaccine denialist. Fourth, some people have malfunctioning immune systems and are unable to receive vaccinations or receive any benefit from them, even if they wanted to. In these four ways, vaccine denialism causes preventable disease to be spread through the general population. Vaccine denialism harms multiple people and not just the vaccine denialist. This last point is what makes vaccine denialism so serious. When a person chooses to avoid vaccines, he chooses not only to potentially harm himself, he also chooses to potentially harm all those he comes in contact with, and all the people that those people come in contact with, and so on. When a person chooses to not wear his seat belt while driving, he is only putting himself at risk. When a person chooses to avoid vaccines, he is putting his whole community at risk. Vaccine denialism is not like one person deciding to not wear his seat belt. It is more like one random person forcing a large segment of his community to not wear their seat belts, despite their desires otherwise. As another metaphor, vaccine denialism is not like one person smoking a cigarette in his own home. Although smoking has been firmly established to be harmful to your health, it is still legal based on grounds of personal liberty since it harms no one else. In contrast, vaccine denialism is more like one random person forcing a large segment of his community to smoke cigarettes.",

The isotopic shifts between hydrogen and deuterium peaks are often used to identify functional groups in spectroscopy.\n\nIn summary, deuteration has a significant effect on the vibration of molecules by lowering the frequencies of the molecular vibrations.",

The homological genus replaces the holomorphic forms with certain cohomology groups, and captures the topological structure of the mirror symmetric objects. \n\nThe HMS conjecture predicts that the generating functions of Gromov-Witten invariants and certain Floer homology groups for the mirror pairs are related by a transformation involving the homological genus.
