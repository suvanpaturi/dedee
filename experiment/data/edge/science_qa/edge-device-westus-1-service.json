        "query": "Why was color invented by humans?",
        "response": "Color was not invented by humans. Color is a fundamental physical property of light that exists independent of humans. How color is perceived by a certain person is of course human dependent. For example, a standard helium-neon laser always emits a specific red color (scientifically, its color is the color with a wavelength of 632.8 nanometers). Whether a person perceives this color as sharp, dull, alarming, vibrant, evocative, romantic, muddy red, brick red, orange-red, or even yellow (if he is color blind) depends entirely on the human perception. But this does not change the fact that helium-neon lasers emit light with the color 632.8 nm red. A machine can measure the color of helium-neon laser light and will find it to be 632.8 nm red every time, no matter which humans are running the machine. In fact, even a blind person that has never experienced sight can be trained to run a machine that measures the color of helium-neon laser light to be 632.8 nm red. The blind person will not a have a personal conception of what red actually looks like, but he should have no great difficulty measuring and scientifically describing red. The same is true of all colors and not just 632.8 nm red. The blind person's experience is similar to that of a human with sight looking at an infrared color. None of us can see an infrared color. Therefore, none of us has any concept of what infrared really \"looks like\" in the human sense of the word. But infrared still exists physically and can be created and detected using machines. An infrared camera helps a human \"see\" infrared colors by converting the infrared colors to red or green. An infrared camera, therefore, does not really allow you to see infrared colors. It allows you to see red colors that are in the same spatial pattern as the infrared colors. An intelligent alien on a distant planet that has never had sight can still measure the color red using tools in a similar way to how humans measure infrared colors without being able to see them. Physically, there are two kinds of colors: pure spectral colors and mixed colors. A pure spectral color consists of a beam of light that is a simple sine wave with a single wavelength. The wavelength of the light is the color of the light. Light is a waving of the electromagnetic field. The distance in space between the peaks of an electromagnetic wave is its wavelength, and hence its color. When you run a narrow beam of white light through a glass prism, it spreads the light out into its spectral colors. The resulting red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet pattern (and all the colors in between) shows the span of possible visible spectral colors. Red has a relatively long wavelength (compared to the other visible colors). On the other end of the visible spectrum, violet has a relatively short wavelength. All of the visible colors have wavelengths that are on the scale of hundreds of nanometers (or tenths of microns). A mixed color is a combination of spectral colors. Exactly how much of each spectral color is added to the mix determines what the final color is. As before, the exact nature of a mixed color is a physical property that exists independent of humans. How a mixed color is perceived is human-dependent. We can say scientifically that 10 Watts of 700 nm red light added to 5 Watts of 530 nm green light and 5 Watts of 470 nm blue light makes a mixed color that exists physically and is independent of humans. Whether humans call this mixed color \"pink\", \"fushia\", \"peach\", \"salmon\", \"romantic\", or \"George\" makes no difference to the fact that it exists scientifically. Human sight is actually quite limited. Healthy humans have only three color receptors: red, green, and blue. While it's true that the red receptors can also pick up orange and yellow, all these colors get collapsed down to a single \"red\" nerve signal. In the same way, the green receptors can detect yellow, green, and blue colors, but they all get collapsed down by the green receptor to a single \"green\" nerve signal. The same case holds for the blue receptors as well. What this means is that the color that you get when you mix red light and green light looks to a human the same as a pure spectral yellow light, even though pure yellow and red+green are scientifically different. If a certain explosive chemical can only be ignited by spectral yellow light, then red+green light will never make the stuff explode, even though human eyes can't tell the difference. This limitation of human eyes is called \"metamerism\". Scientifically speaking, the human eyes are very bad detectors for measuring the true nature of a certain mixed color. A typical mixed color has many different spectral color components, and not just red, green, and blue. We want to therefore use machines and measure all the spectral colors present in a mixed color in order to accurately describe it. Each spectral color can be present in large or small amounts. In order to completely describe a mixed color scientifically, we have to tell the power and wavelength of each spectral component. The resulting plot of a certain mixed color is called its \"spectral power distribution\" or just its \"spectrum\" for short. If you ask a random intelligent human, \"What is the color of the sun?\", you will get the inexact answer \"white\". But if you ask a solar scientist or a spectrometer machine this same question, the answer will be the solar spectrum.",

At high temperatures, the electrical conductivity of the metal is normal, but as the temperature is lowered, the electrical conductivity decreases.

Specifically, an orbifold is a topological space that locally looks like the quotient of a Euclidean space by a finite group action, but with additional restrictions on the type of singularities allowed. These singularities are required to be of a specific type, called \"good\" singularities, which can be described in terms of the action of the group on the space.\n\nThe cohomology of an orbifold can be defined in a similar way as the cohomology of a manifold, by considering the space of differential forms on the orbifold and defining a de Rham complex. However, since an orbifold has certain singularities, the cohomology groups of an orbifold can be more complicated than those of a manifold. In particular, there can be additional orbifold cohomology classes that capture the information about the singularities of the orbifold.\n\nIn summary, an orbifold is a space with singularities that can be understood by quotients of a Euclidean space by a finite group action, and its cohomology is a generalization of the cohomology of a manifold that captures the information about these singularities.",

This pathway involves the interaction between the p53 protein and the mdm2 protein, which is a negative regulator of p53.\n\nUnder normal conditions, mdm2 binds to p53 and inactivates it by promoting its degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system. However, when there is cellular stress, such as DNA damage or oncogenic signaling, p53 is activated and induces the expression of mdm2. This forms a feedback loop, wherein mdm2 negatively regulates p53, while p53 activates mdm2 to keep its own levels in check.\n\nWhen there is too much stress, p53 overcomes the negative regulation of mdm2 and accumulates in the cell, leading to the activation of a range of downstream targets that mediate cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, or apoptosis. Dysregulation of the p53-mdm2 pathway is often observed in cancer, contributing to the development of tumors by suppressing p53 activity.",

        "query": "Why can't color blind people see any colors?",
        "response": "Most people with color blindness can see almost all colors. They are typically only blind to a few colors. Furthermore, they are not completely blind to those colors, but are only partially blind. The human eye contains three types of color detecting cells: red-detecting cones, green-detecting cones, and blue-detecting cones. Each cone cell can detect many colors in addition to its main color. For instance, the cone cells in the eye that can see red light can also see orange and yellow. The red cone cells just see red the best, and that is why they are called the red cones. Similarly, the green cones can also see orange, yellow and blue. This overlap is what allows humans to see so many different colors. Humans can see the color yellow, for instance, even though there are no yellow receptors, because of this overlap. When you look at a yellow flower, the yellow light stimulates the red and green cells in your eyes, and your brain interprets a little bit of red plus a little bit of green as yellow. Typically, a color blind person has only one type of light cell absent or non-functioning. The textbook Color Vision, edited by Werner Backhaus, Reinhold Kliegl, and John Simon Werner, states that about 1% of Caucasian males have partial color blindness with one of the three color receptor types absent or non-functioning. This book further states that people who are completely color blind; those with all three types of receptors absent or non-functioning; are \"extremely rare\". People with protanopia color blindness lack the red detecting cone cells or pigments. As a result, they do not see red or orange colors as well. But they see all the other colors just fine. People with deuteranopia color blindness lack the green detecting cones or pigments, but have their other cones working just fine. People with tritanopia color blindness lack the blue detecting cones. People with these three types of partial color blindness only have problems with a few colors and can see most colors just fine. You should keep in mind that the response of the different color-detecting cells overlap. When a person with full vision looks at a pure blue wall, it is not just his blue cone cells that are stimulated. His blue cone cells are stimulated a lot and his green cone cells are stimulated a little. His brain therefore experiences pure blue as a large blue cell signal plus a small green cell signal because of the way their responses overlap. Now apply this concept to a color blind person. A person with tritanopia is missing the blue-detecting cells in his eyes. When he looks at a blue wall, his blue cells don't see anything because he is missing the blue cells. But the green-detecting cells are still there, and they see blue a little bit. In this way, a typical color blind person is not really completely blind to any color. But his brain experiences a small green signal as dark green. A person with blue color blindness therefore experiences pure blue as dark green. His color perception is not complete and not quite right, but he does experience color, even in the color range where he has greatest difficulty. Whereas a person with full vision sees the colors green, blue, and violet, a person with blue color blindness sees these colors as green, dark green, and darker green. He sees color. He just sees the colors slightly wrong and has a harder time telling certain colors apart. Another point to keep in mind is that most colors that we see in everyday life are a mixture of fundamental colors. For instance, in terms of fundamental colors, pink is a mixture of a lot of red plus a little of orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet. When a person with blue color blindness looks at pink, only the blue part of the color mixture is faulty, which is a small part of the color pink. As a result, pink looks nearly normal to a person with blue color blindness. The same goes for other colors that are a mixture of fundamental colors. Also, there is more to an object than its color. An object also has brightness, shading, texture, and shape. If a chair that is painted pure red is placed in front of a person with red color blindness, she would have no problem seeing the chair. She would still see the shape, shading, texture, and brightness of the chair. She would still see some color in the chair too. The chair would just look dark yellow instead of red. In this way, people with color blindness are not really \"blind\". They can see all objects just fine. Better phrases would be \"incomplete color vision\" or \"less sensitive color vision\". Finally, people with color blindness learn to use mental tricks to compensate for the deficiency. For instance, oranges are always orange and stop signs are always red. A person with red color blindness has a harder time telling apart red and orange, but he can sure tell the difference between an orange and a stop sign. Even though the color difference between these two objects is very subtle for him, he feels that the color is very different because he associates the object identity with its color, and stop signs are very different from oranges. If you place a pure red posterboard next to a pure orange posterboard, a person with red color blindness may have a hard time identifying the red object. But place a stop sign next to an orange and ask him to identify the red object, and he will have no problem pointing to the stop sign as red. He may even think he is actually seeing red in this case, when he is just mostly seeing an object he has associated with the word red. Similarly, a color blind person typically has no problem driving and obeying traffic lights. You may think that he can't tell red lights from green lights and won't know when to stop or go. In reality, he may not see these lights in their full color, but he can see enough color to tell them apart. Additionally, he comes to associate the top light with red and the bottom light with green without even realizing it. He may tell you he is \"remembering the color\", when in reality he is remembering the location of the traffic light that means \"go\" and \"stop\". In this way, color blind people sometimes think they are fully seeing colors even though they are not because they are unconsciously relying on mental tricks and associations to compensate. This post is meant in no way to trivialize or underestimate the burden that color blind people suffer in having incomplete color vision. Rather, this post is meant to simply uncover the science behind color blindness. Because of their sensitivity to most colors, the overlap of their cone cell response, and the other visual cues connected to an object, most people with color blindness have a nearly complete color experience. (Personal note for those curious: I am not color blind but personally know people who are).",

This distance can have a significant effect on the design and performance of quantum circuits.\n\nIf the interaction distance is too small, it can limit the size and complexity of the circuits that can be constructed.

Angular momentum, on the other hand, is a measure of an object's rotational motion. It is also a vector quantity and is related to the object's mass, angular velocity, and the distance of the object's mass from the axis of rotation.\n\nIn some cases, momentum can be converted into angular momentum or vice versa. For example, when an object with momentum travels in a circular path around an axis, its momentum is converted into angular momentum. This is because the object's momentum is causing it to move in a circular motion around the axis, which creates rotation and thus angular momentum. Similarly, when an object with angular momentum stops rotating around an axis, its angular momentum is converted back into linear momentum. \n\nTherefore, the relationship between momentum and angular momentum comes from the fact that they are both measures of motion, but they refer to different types of motion - linear and rotational.",

        "query": "Why is the moon so bright?",
        "response": "The moon is actually quite dim, compared to other astronomical bodies. The moon only seems bright in the night sky because it is so close to the earth and because the trees, houses, and fields around you are so dark at night. In fact, the moon is one of the least reflective objects in the solar system. The DSCOVER spacecraft captured this single photograph of the moon and the earth. Both the earth and the moon are illuminated by the same amount of sunlight coming from the same angle in this photo. As you can see in this photo, the earth is much brighter than the moon. In general, we can see objects because they direct light into our eyes (or into cameras which record information that is later used by display screens to direct light into our eyes). There are two main ways that an object can direct light into our eyes. Either the object creates new light or it reflects light that already existed. Objects that create light tend to also reflect ambient light, so that they tend to be the brightest objects around. Examples include campfires, light bulbs, candle flames, and computer screens. In terms of astronomical bodies, stars are the main objects that create significant amounts of visible light, and therefore are some of the brightest objects in the universe. In contrast, planets and moons do not generate their own visible light*. If a planet somehow became large enough to initiate nuclear fusion and begin glowing, it would no longer be a planet. It would be a star. Since planets and moons do not emit light, the only reason we can see them is because they reflect light from some other source. The strongest source of light in our solar system is the sun, so usually we see planets and moons because they are reflecting sunlight. The amount of sunlight incident on a moon or planet that gets reflected depends on the materials in its surface and atmosphere as well as its surface roughness. Snow, rough ice, and clouds are highly reflective. Most types of rock are not. Therefore, a planet that is covered with clouds, such as Earth or Venus, is generally brighter than a rocky moon or planet that has no atmosphere. There are two main types of reflectivity: specular reflectivity and diffuse reflectivity. Specular reflectivity measures how much of the incoming light gets reflected by the object in the direction given by the mirror angle. In contrast, diffuse reflectivity measures how much light gets reflected in all directions. A mirror has high specular reflectivity and low diffuse reflectivity. In contrast, sand has low specular reflectivity and high diffuse reflectivity. In everyday life, we experience specular reflectivity as the perception of mirror images and glare spots on the surface of objects. We experience diffuse reflectivity as a somewhat uniform brightness and color that exists on the surface of the object and is roughly the same no matter what our viewing angle is. Many objects display significant amounts of both specular reflectivity and diffuse reflectivity. For instance, a red polished sports car looks red from all angles because of its diffuse reflectivity, while at the same time displays bright spots of glare because of its specular reflectivity. In general, roughening a surface tends to increase its diffuse reflectivity and decrease its specular reflectivity. This is true because a rough surface has many little reflecting planes all oriented differently which scatter light in many different directions. In fact, the easiest way to turn a strong specular reflector into a strong diffuse reflector is to roughen it up. For instance, take a smooth sheet of ice and scratch it up. You turn a surface that is bright only in the mirror direction of the light source into a surface that bright in all directions. When it comes to planets and moons, the surface roughness is quite high. For this reason, their overall brightness is best described by their diffuse reflectivity. There are several ways to define and measure the diffuse reflectivity. In the context of planets and moons, the common and perhaps most useful way is to define it in terms of \"bond albedo\". The bond albedo is the average amount of total light scattered by the body in any direction, relative to the total amount of light that is incident. A bond albedo of 0% represents a perfectly black object and a bond albedo of 100% represents an object that scatters all of the light. The earth has a bond albedo of 31%. In contrast, the moon has a bond albedo of 12%. To bring this closer to home, the moon has the same bond albedo as old asphalt, such as is found in roads and parking lots. The bond albedo of major objects in our solar system are listed below as reported in the textbook Fundamental Planetary Science: Physics, Chemistry, and Habitability by Jack K. Lissauer and Imke de Pater. As this table makes clear, the moon is one of the dimmest objects in our solar system. If Triton, one of Neptune's moons, were to become the moon of the earth, then it would be about seven times brighter in the night sky than our current moon. Triton is bright because almost all of its surface is covered by several layers of rough ice. In contrast, earth's moon is so dark because it contains very little ice, snow, water, clouds, and atmosphere. The moon consists mostly of rock dust and dark rocks that are similar in composition to rocks on earth. The albedo values in the table above are averages since the albedo varies through time. For example, the number of clouds covering the earth varies from season to season. Therefore, the albedo of the earth varies a few percent throughout the year. The perceived brightness of a planet or moon (i.e. what we see with our eyes), depends on three things: (1) the object's albedo, (2) the total amount of light that is hitting the object in the first place, and (3) the distance between the object and the eye or camera that is viewing it. Planets and moons that are closer to the sun receive much more sunlight and therefore generally have a higher perceived brightness. Also, planets and moons that are closer to the earth have more of their reflected light reach the earth and therefore generally have a higher perceived brightness as seen from earth. The moon indeed looks brighter than Venus to a human standing on earth's surface, but that's just because the moon is so close to earth. *Note that many planets and moons can create small amounts of light through localized phenomena. Examples of such phenomena include lightning, glowing lava, and atmospheric aurora. While such phenomena can lead to stunning photos when captured by nearby spacecraft, they generate such little light that they do not contribute significantly to the brightness of the planet or moon when viewed from a distance.",

The theory is based on a game called the jeu de taquin, which involves sliding tiles in a square or rectangular grid according to certain rules.\n\nThe basic idea is to associate Young tableaux with Schubert varieties in such a way that the jeu de taquin rules preserve the cohomology of the variety. This allows us to compute the cohomology by counting certain combinatorial objects associated with the Young tableaux.\n\nThe theory has many applications in algebraic geometry, representation theory, and combinatorics.

This escape of particles from the black hole causes it to slowly evaporate over time, losing its mass and therefore its gravity. This process is very slow for large black holes and extremely rapid for small black holes. However, despite decades of effort, the radiation has yet to be directly observed.",

        "response": "The microwaves in a microwave oven are not tuned to a resonant frequency of water. In fact, the microwaves generated inside a microwave oven are not really tuned to any particular resonant frequency since the waves are broadband. A broadband electromagnetic wave contains many frequencies. You need a monochromatic wave (a nearly single-frequency wave) in order to tune to a specific frequency. Laser beams are monochromatic. Radio waves from simple antennas are monochromatic. Microwaves in an microwave oven are not monochromatic. The microwaves in a microwave oven are created by a device called a magnetron, which is a resonant cavity that causes current to naturally oscillate at high frequency, and thereby emit electromagnetic waves. The oscillation of the current in the magnetron is not caused by a delicately-controlled external circuit. Rather, the oscillation arises naturally from the way that electrons emitted by the cathode hit the anode in a random fashion and then slosh around as directed by the magnetron's shape. This randomness causes the magnetron to emit many frequencies. Furthermore, the random nature of the oscillation generation also causes the frequencies to be unstable and quickly jump around. A study of a typical household microwave oven conducted by Michal Soltysiak, Malgorzata Celuch, and Ulrich Erle, and published in IEEE's Microwave Symposium Digest, found that the oven's frequency spectrum contained several broad peaks that spanned from 2.40 to 2.50 GHz. Furthermore, they found that the location, shape, and even the number of broad peaks in the frequency spectrum depended on the orientation of the object that was in the oven being heated. In other words, the exact frequencies present in the electromagnetic waves that fill the oven depend on the details of the food itself. Clearly, the microwaves cannot be tuned in frequency to anything particular if the frequencies change every time you heat a different food. In applications where stable monochromaticity is important, such as in radar imaging, the magnetron therefore has limited utility. In applications where energy delivery is more important than monochromaticity, such as in a kitchen oven, the magnetron is ideal. So how do microwaves in an oven heat food if they are not tuned to a specific resonant frequency of water? They heat the food through simple dielectric heating. In dielectric heating, the electric field in the electromagnetic wave exerts a force on the molecules in the food, causing them to rotate in order to align with the field. Because of this rotating motion, the molecules collide into each other and convert their somewhat ordered rotational motion into disordered motion, which we macroscopically call heat. Many types of molecules in the food absorb energy from the microwaves in this way, and not just water molecules. The book Electromagnetics Explained, by Ron Schmitt states: There is a popular myth that explains microwave ovens as operating at a special resonance of water molecules. In reality, this myth is just that, a myth. Referring to the Figure 15.2, you can see that there is no resonance of water at this frequency. The first resonant peak occurs above 1THz, and the highest loss occurs well into the infrared. There is no special significance of 2.45 GHz, except that it is allocated by the FCC as being allowable for microwave oven usage.",

        "response": "Dogs do sweat. Sweating is a physiological response to heat where sweat glands secrete salty water. When the water evaporates, it takes energy with it, cooling down the organism in the process. Although dogs don't sweat profusely and visibly the way humans do, they definitely have sweat glands that secrete sweat in response to heat. The problem is that most dogs are covered with a thick coat of fur, so sweat secreted where there is fur would get trapped in the fur, fail to evaporate, and therefore fail to cool the dog down much. As a result, it is far more efficient for dogs to have sweat glands where there is little fur. For this reason, most of a dog's sweat glands are located on the pads of its feet and on its nose. On a hot day you may notice a dog leaving behind a trail of wet footprints as it walks across a smooth, dry surface. That's dog sweat. With far fewer effective places for dogs to have body-cooling sweat glands as compared to humans, dogs must rely on another mechanism to keep cool. The primary cooling mechanism for dogs is panting. By breathing air quickly over the wet surfaces of the inner mouth and lungs, the dog's pants accelerate evaporative cooling in much the same way that a breeze across a sweaty person's skin speeds up cooling. Dogs also have a different kind of sweat gland all over their body. But the sweat emitted from these glands are used to counter rapid rises of temperature in localized skin patches that could lead to burns, and not to cool the body as a whole. The Textbook of Small Animal Surgery edited by Douglas H. Slatter states, \"Merocrine glands are coiled, simple, tubular glands found mainly in the footpads of dogs; they empty directly onto the epidermal surface. Sweat glands are better developed in the canine breeds that have long, fine hair. Sweat glands in the hairy skin of dogs and cats [apocrine glands] do not participate actively in the central thermoregulatory mechanism but protect the skin from excessive rise in temperature.\"",

The resulting topological constraints lead to stable, robust vortex-like structures, which are attractive for potential applications in data storage and processing.",

        "query": "Can air make shadows?",
        "response": "Yes, air can indeed make shadows. A shadow occurs when an object in a light beam prevents some of the light from continuing on in the forward direction. When the light beam hits a wall or the ground, a darker shape is visible where less light is hitting the surface. Both the light and the shadow, which is just the absence of light, travel to the surface at the speed of light. There are three ways that an object can prevent light from continuing on in the forward direction: Consider completely transparent objects such as glass cups, bottles of water, or the lenses of eyeglasses. Even though such transparent objects do not absorb or reflect very much light, they still interact with light through refraction. Refraction is what makes transparent cups visible to our eyes. Refraction also enables clear objects to cast shadows. Take off your eyeglasses and place them on the table at night under the illumination of a single lamp and you will see a distinct shadow caused by the transparent lenses. Although air is almost perfectly transparent, it can still cast shadows via refraction. The key principle regarding refraction is that light is bent when the index of refraction differs from one location to the next. Air and glass are different materials and have different indices of refraction. Light therefore bends when it goes from air into glass, such as at the surface of a glass lens. Refraction does not happen inside a glass lens because the material inside the lens is uniform. Refraction happens at the surface of a glass lens because that is the only place where the index of refraction differs. Uniform air itself cannot refract light and create shadows because the index of refraction does not differ anywhere. But, when different regions of air have different indices of refraction, the air can indeed bend light away from the forward direction and create a shadow. The most common way to get a changing index of refraction in different regions of air is to heat the air. As air heats up, it expands and its index of refraction changes. A pocket of warm air sitting next to a pocket of cold air will therefore constitute regions with different indices of refraction. The interface between the cold air and the warm air will therefore bend light and cause shadows. This effect is most visible when strong direct sunlight is coming in sideways through a window, passes through cold ambient air and then passes through the hot air above a heater. The shadow that this air system creates on the far wall consists of waving, rolling lines mimicking the turbulent motion of the hot air as it rises. The index of refraction of air also changes as the pressure and composition changes, therefore these effects can also lead to air shadows. For instance, the pressure variations caused by a plane plowing through the air can cause shadows. Also, gases being vented into ambient air creates spatial variations in the air, and therefore shadow-causing variations in the index of refraction. The ability of non-uniform air to create shadows is used to great advantage in the imaging technique known as schlieren photography. In schlieren photography, the shadows are used to accurately map out the variations in the air, as shown below.",

It is based on the idea of separating the solution into two parts: a dominant part and a small correction term. The method involves a series of iterative calculations to obtain progressively better approximations of the solution. The iteration process assumes that the dominant part of the solution can be expressed as an asymptotic expansion and that the correction term is much smaller than the dominant part. The method is particularly useful for solving differential equations that have a large parameter or are difficult to solve using other methods.",

It is essentially a sheaf of categories over a topological space, which describes the possible fiber categories of a bundle or gerbe over that space. \n\nMore specifically, a basic bundle gerbe is a stack of categories that assigns to each open subset U of a fixed topological space X a category, where objects of that category represent fiber functors over U. These categories are required to satisfy certain coherence conditions, which ensure that they are compatible with each other and that they assemble into a well-behaved sheaf over X.\n\nThe concept of a basic bundle gerbe is a useful tool in mathematics, particularly in the study of differential geometry and quantum field theory. It allows geometric objects such as vector bundles and connections to be described in a natural way using category theory, which facilitates their manipulation and analysis.",

Cosmological constraints on this model can be obtained from a variety of sources, including cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations, supernova surveys, and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements.\n\nOne way to constrain oscillating dark energy is to use the CMB. The CMB is an important source of information about the early universe, and provides valuable insights into the nature of dark energy. To study oscillating dark energy using the CMB, researchers typically analyze the temperature and polarization anisotropy of the CMB. This can provide information about the properties of dark energy, including its equation of state (i.e., the relationship between its pressure and energy density).\n\nAnother way to constrain oscillating dark energy is to use supernova surveys. Supernovae are among the brightest and most energetic events in the universe, and can be used as standard candles to measure the distance to distant objects. By studying the properties of supernovae at different distances, researchers can gain insight into the properties of dark energy.\n\nFinally, BAO measurements can be used to constrain oscillating dark energy. BAOs are subtle distortions in the distribution of matter in the universe, caused by sound waves that traveled through the early universe. By studying the patterns of these distortions, researchers can measure the expansion rate of the universe and infer the properties of dark energy.\n\nOverall, cosmological constraints on oscillating dark energy are still in their early stages, and more observations and theoretical modeling are needed to fully understand this intriguing dark energy model.",

Backyard plants such as poison oak, poison ivy, and poison sumac should never be eaten. Mind-altering drugs like marijuana, tobacco, and cocaine all come from plants. Eighty four varieties of mushroom are toxic according to the book \"Clinical Toxicology\" by Marsha Ford. Even kidney beans are toxic when eaten undercooked, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. (The FDA states that kidney beans must be soaked for at least five hours and boiled for at least ten minutes in order to deactivate the toxin. Slow cookers that do not bring the beans to a boil do not render them safe.) Many berries are poisonous, even ones on plants that otherwise provide edible substances, such as asparagus. Even deceptively beautiful plants such as wisteria, foxglove, or hydrangea will make you sick if ingested, according to the A.D.A.M Medical Encyclopedia. Too much licorice can give you dangerously high blood pressure. \r\nAs another example, herbal tea made from poppy seeds has killed several people because of the lethal levels of narcotics that can occur naturally in the tea. In general, it is a good idea to not consume any wildflower, herb, berry, seed, mushroom, or herbal tea until you have done some research and are certain it is safe. Additionally, just because someone has taken a plant, put it in a pill, and is selling it as an herbal supplement does not make it safe. Most herbal supplements are not regulated by the government the way medicine is. As reported by Dr. Anna Licata in her review study, \"Herbal Hepatotoxicity: a hidden epidemic,\" herbal pill sellers market their products as food and thereby avoid all drug regulations. They do this despite the fact that the herbs are used for their drug properties. Prescription medicine has strict safety measures in place at every stage of its existence: from the research and testing stage, to the drug approval stage, to the point where a licensed doctor prescribes it, and finally at the point where a certified pharmacist distributes it. Herbal pills have none of these safety measures in place. As Dr. Licata states, \"There is ample evidence indicating that herbs may have harmful effects and produce adverse interactions with prescription drugs as well. This would suggest that the side effects of herbal products are often underreported. Unlike prescription drugs, there are no databases linking herb consumption to later medical problems.\" Eating water hemlock root, which is easily mistaken for parsnip, will kill you almost every time. Properly taking a prescription stomach acid reducer will never kill you. The bottom line is that plants and herbal supplements can be more dangerous than medicine from a lab because herbs have just as powerful drug effects but don't have the safety regulations in place. Even if \"natural\" did mean \"harmless\" and \"healthy\" (which is a dangerous viewpoint), there is very little that is \"natural\" these days. Herbal supplements claim to be natural, and therefore healthy, but they have been processed and chemically altered to end up in pill form. Even chewing on a fresh tomato from your garden may not be as natural as you think. The tomato seeds you bought from the store are the culmination of centuries of human intervention including cross-breeding and other forms of genetic engineering. Eating a truly natural food would require moving to an unknown island that man has never touched and eating its wild herbs. But I wouldn't recommend it, as you would probably discover the experience to be neither harmless nor healthy. The misconception that \"natural\" always equals \"safe\" and \"man-made\" always equals \"unsafe\" extends beyond herbs. For example, some people may consider cell phones and microwaves dangerous because they are man-made. But the sun bombards humans with radio waves more consistently than cell phones, and with microwaves more consistently than ovens. Rocks in the ground and distant supernovae bombard the average human with more nuclear radiation than next-door nuclear power plants. The natural mineral named \"asbestos\" causes fatal lung diseases. Lightning bolts can electrocute people just as easily as downed power lines. Even plain old water can kill you if taken in large quantities (a condition known as dilutional hyponatremia). For every man-made danger, there are worse natural dangers of the same type.",

However, to determine the exact luminosity of a specific GRB, more information such as distance and duration is needed.",

In this approach, the evolution of the quantum system is described using a stochastic Schr\u00f6dinger equation, which includes a random Wiener process that models the effect of the random fluctuations on the system.\n\nThe basic idea behind the quantum trajectory approach is to treat the measurement as a continuous process that is monitored by continuously recording the state of the quantum system. The approach provides a way to understand how quantum systems evolve and interact with their environment, and can be used to solve a wide range of physics problems, such as the behavior of qubits in quantum computers and the behavior of electrons in complex materials.\n\nThe quantum trajectory approach has been shown to be an effective tool for analyzing the behavior of a wide range of quantum systems, and is widely used in both theoretical and experimental research.",

        "query": "Have aliens ever visited earth?",
        "response": "According to the findings of mainstream science, aliens have never visited the earth. Despite the whimsical fantasies of fictional works and the confusion of supposed eye-witnesses, there is no credible scientific evidence that aliens have ever visited the earth. Aliens did not visit the earth anciently and build the pyramids, nor do they sneak onto our planet in our day. Because of the unreliability of the human eyes and human brain, scientific data is established through (1) quantification, (2) use of accurate tools, and (3) repetition. Quantification means that instead of a human giving a subjective account, the human \u2013 or better yet, a machine \u2013 measures a number to determine a property. For instance, \"it feels hot outside\" is a subjective statement of little scientific value. Is it hot enough to melt chocolate? Is it hot enough to melt steel? Does it just feel hot to the person making the statement because she just started menopause? We don't know from this statement. A quantified statement such as \"it is 90 degrees Fahrenheit outside\" is more reliable, and therefore scientific. Next, the use of accurate tools means that a proven measurement tool is used to make the measurement instead of the human's eyes. For instance, a builder who needs to measure a stud so he can cut the drywall to fit it does not just look at the stud and guess its length. He uses a tape measure to get an accurate value for the length. Lastly, repetition ensures that freak errors in measurement are identified and discarded. Builders know that they have to measure twice if they only want to cut once. Repetition also allows a value to be measured several times and averaged so as to minimize noise. Repetition means that one person takes the measurement several times, but it also means that other people make the measurement. Measurements repeated by different people minimize the error effects of a single faulty tool or confused human. If a builder uses a tape measure that has the numbers printed wrong, he may consistently get the same measurement, but it will still be wrong. Repetition by others will minimize such errors. In every area of life, and not just in the lab, data is not reliable unless is has been quantified, measured by an accurate tool, and repeated. The alleged eye-witness accounts of UFO's and alien visitations fail to be reliable data on all accounts. When a man tells a newspaper that he saw a bright light over his farm that looked like it had an alien face inside, he has provided no quantified information, he has used no tools to make his measurement, and he is unable to repeat or have others repeat the measurement. Three strikes against him means that such accounts are completely unreliable. If an alleged UFO witness actually went up to his awe-inspiring blob of light and tried to measure its width, temperature, etc. he would quickly find that reflections from clouds were playing tricks on his eyes or that fireflies were migrating. According to current reliable data, aliens have never visited earth, contacted earth, or even given any hint of their existence. These facts do not automatically rule out the existence of life on other planets. They just indicate that their influence has not yet reached earth. Most alien accounts involve seeing something strange in the sky or a strange creature on the earth. The following objects, events, and experiences could be easily misunderstood to be aliens by unreliable human eyes: Natural Objects\nFireflies: glowing beetles that can look like large objects when swarming\nBarn owls: owls that have alien-like faces\nMeteorites: falling space rocks that glow, burn, and explode\r\n Electrical Disturbances\nCorona discharge: glowing clouds of sparks around charged objects\nCloud to ground lightning: traditional lighting\nCloud to cloud lightning: lightning that causes clouds to glow\nElves, Sprites, & Blue Jets: exotic-looking forms of lightning\nIonospheric air glow: steady glow high in the ionosphere\r\n Atmospheric Optical Effects\nAurorae: streaking glow caused by particles hitting the atmosphere\nClouds: some clouds can have space-ship-like shapes and colors\nMirages: the bending of light by air can make ships appear in the sky\nRainbows: bow-like scattering of sunlight by raindrops\nFogbows: bow-like scattering of sunlight by fog\nSun dogs: bright spots due to scattering of sunlight by ice crystals\nMoon dogs: bright spots due to scattering of moonlight by ice crystals\nLight pillars: streaks of light due to scattering by ice crystals\nCircumhorizontal halos: arcs due to scattering of sunlight by ice crystals\nSearchlights: high-power man-made light beams scanning the sky\nLaser guides: laser beams used to calibrate astronomical telescopes\nEarthquake lights: flahses caused by earthquakes\r\n Man-Made Craft\nAirplanes: advanced airplanes have unusual shapes\nHelicopters: advanced helicopters have unusual shapes\nHot-air balloons: aircraft filled with buoyant hor air\nWeather balloons: silvery balloons carrying weather instruments\nDirigibles: steerable balloons that come in a variety of shapes\nKites: kites can come in just about any shape imaginable\nFlares: bright projectile that streaks across the sky \nMilitary drones: unmanned aircraft that can come in alien-like shapes\nCommerical drones: unmanned aircraft used for sensing and delivery\nRC airplanes: small unmanned hobby planes flown by radio control\nRC helicopters: small unmanned hobby helicopters flown by radio control\nSatellites: odd-shaped machines in orbit around the earth\nRockets: fire-propelled object that comes in many sizes\nMan-made spacecraft: various manned and unmanned spaceships\nFrisbees: gliding toys thrown in the air\r\n Psychological Effects\nHallucinations caused by alcohol or drugs\nHallucinations caused by various medical diseases\nHallucinations caused by an abnormal fear response\nHoaxes and pranks carried out by other humans",

In short, this is a type of cryptography that relies on the properties of elliptic curves to create a mathematical \"trapdoor\" that is difficult to reverse without certain secret parameters. By manipulating points on the curve, it's possible to create secure encryption and decryption algorithms that are resistant to certain types of attacks.\n\nThe supersingular property plays a role in this because it allows for certain types of computations to be performed more efficiently. Specifically, when a curve is supersingular, it has a larger number of points in its group than non-supersingular curves of the same size. This means that some computations that are difficult on non-supersingular curves can be performed more efficiently on supersingular curves.\n\nOverall, the supersingular property is just one of many factors that can make an elliptic curve useful for cryptography.

The air conditioner uses very little energy. On the other hand, rolling down the windows introduces significant air resistance that the motor must use energy to overcome. The energy lost to drag is higher than to the air conditioner when driving at highway speeds. As reported by the Chicago Tribune in August 2010, \"An SAE study conducted at the GM Proving Grounds and in a GM wind tunnel on a full-size car and a large SUV showed that increased wind resistance from running with windows down at more than 55 mph cuts gas mileage by 20 percent, while running the air conditioning cuts gas mileage by 10 percent.\" In other words, having the windows down worsens gas mileage twice as much as having the air conditioner on at highway speeds.

Gill, birds must instead rely on the muscular stomach-like pouch called the gizzard to crush down their food. Many species swallow stones and grit to aid in digestion. These stones remain in the gizzard and crush the food as the gizzard contracts. From a functional perspective, gizzard stones in birds are the equivalent of teeth in humans. When a gizzard stone becomes too smooth to do its job, the bird regurgitates the stone or passes the stone down and out through its digestive tract. Species that do not swallow stones are able to use the sheer muscle power of their gizzards to grind down their food. Birds do not have teeth because the teeth and the jaw bone to support them are too heavy for efficient flight. Many birds have a series of notches in their beak or spikes on the inside of their beak or tongue. These notches and spikes are not true teeth as they are not used to crush down their food. Instead, these features are used to get a good grip on the prey so that it does not escape. In ancient evolutionary history, there were birds with true teeth.

The shock wave that forms as a result of this interaction can cause the fluid flow to separate and become turbulent, leading to losses in energy and efficiency.\n\nBow knots, also known as vortex rings, occur when a fluid flow creates a swirling motion that forms into a ring. These rings can cause flow separation and turbulence, resulting in energy losses and reduced efficiency.\n\nOverall, these phenomena are all related to the complex interactions and disturbances that can occur in fluid flows, and can have significant impacts on the performance and efficiency of various mechanical systems.",

According to the book \"Improving Animal Welfare\" by Temple Grandin, cattle lack the red retina receptor and can only see yellow, green, blue, and violet colors. Color vision in mammals is accomplished by a collection of cone cells on the back of the eye (the retina). There are three kinds of cone cells: one kind that detects predominantly red colors, another kind that detects mainly green, and the last kind that detects mainly blue. Although cone cells respond most strongly to their main color, they can still respond to other close colors. This color overlap of the cones' sensitivity is what allows us to see so many colors. For instance, a pure yellow color stimulates both the red cone and the green cone, and we experience the combination as yellow. If instead of looking at a pure yellow dot of light, you looked instead at a red dot very close to a green dot with the right balance, you would still experience yellow because the red cones and green cones are being stimulated in the same way. This fact makes the manufacture of computer screens very practical. Instead of implanting a million pixels into a computer screen at every point, each with a different color, the manufacturer only has to construct a grid of red, green, and blue pixels. Humans are actually looking at an array of red, green, and blue dots on a screen but perceive millions of colors. Most mammals, including bulls, are dichromats. This means that they only have two different kinds of cones, as opposed to the three in humans. Bulls lack the red cones, but still have the green and blue cones. A bull's vision is very similar to the vision of a human with red-cone color blindness, known as protanopia. To them, a red cape looks yellowish-gray.

These waves can be described using the nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation and exhibit interesting behavior, such as maintaining their shape and amplitude despite encountering obstacles and interference.\n\nIn a water wave soliton model, the electric waves would manifest as variations in the electric potential caused by the displacement of the water molecules.

This leads to the holographic principle, which states that the information content of a region of space can be represented by a surface that encloses it. In holographic dark energy models, the cosmological constant is assumed to be proportional to the surface area of the universe, rather than its volume.\n\nInduced gravity is a modification of general relativity in which the gravitational constant is assumed to be a function of the scalar curvature of spacetime. In other words, the strength of gravity is related to the curvature of spacetime, rather than being a fixed constant. This modification is proposed as a way to explain the accelerated expansion of the universe without introducing dark energy.\n\nWhile both approaches attempt to address the cosmological constant problem, they differ in their fundamental assumptions and predictions.

Gravity: As galaxies form and grow, they exert a gravitational force on the surrounding matter. This can cause regions of high and low density in the early universe, which can leave imprints on the CMB.\n\n2. Electromagnetic radiation: Galaxies emit a range of electromagnetic radiation, including radio waves, infrared radiation, and visible light. These emissions can scatter off of electrons and other particles in the early universe, causing small fluctuations in the CMB.\n\n3. Cosmic rays: Cosmic rays are high-energy particles that are thought to originate from supernovae in galaxies.

The polytropic index is related to the adiabatic index \u03b3 of the star by n=1/(\u03b3-1).\n\nThe polytropic model of a quark star is useful in predicting its mass, radius, and other physical properties, and can be used to study the stability and evolution of such stars.

        "response": "Actually, a lot of the outside world on a sunny day is tinted blue because of the blue sky. The blue tinting of the outside world is quite striking if you know how to look for it. Sunlight that has just left the sun contains a relatively equal mix of all spectral colors and is therefore white. When the sunlight passes through the air in earth's atmosphere, some of the light is scattered sideways by the air molecules. The air molecules scatter a little bit of all colors out of the forward-traveling beam of sunlight, but blue and violet colors are scattered the most, giving the sky a whitish-blue appearance. Since more blue and violet light have been removed from the forward traveling beam than other colors, the direct sunlight that reaches earth's surface is slightly tinted orange-red compared to the sunlight given off at the sun's surface. But this orange-red tint is so small (because the total amount of light scattered out by the atmosphere is small compared to the sunlight that continues on in the forward direction) that direct sunlight that reaches earth's surface is still white. The white direct sunlight is much brighter than the blue skylight, and this is the main reason that the entire outside world is not completely blue. White light contains all colors, so a scene illuminated by white light will show all the innate colors of the objects in the scene. When illuminated by white light such as sunlight, we are able to see the grass as green, the flowers as red and wood as brown. The world shows its usual mix of colors when illuminated by white light. White sunlight is so bright compared to blue skylight that when an object is in direct sunlight, it just looks like its innate color. But, when an object is in shadow so that direct sunlight cannot reach it (and there are not too many clouds that block the skylight), the object is now being illuminated only by blue skylight. Shadows on a clear day are therefore blue tinted. The more shadows there are, the more the world around you is tinted blue. When the sun is low in the sky and behind the trees, the entire landscape can end up being shadowed from direct sunlight and therefore be blue tinted. We often don't notice the blueness of the outside world because our human eyes are better at seeing relative color than absolute color. This means that our eyes are better at picking out color differences than at picking out an overall color on an absolute scale, as shown in the image above. But the blue tint of the outside world becomes obvious if you look into an area of deep shadow on a bright, clear day. The blue tint of shadows can make for dazzling scenery worthy of being painted or photographed.",

Sucking all the particles and fields out of a certain volume won't make the space completely empty because new particles will still flash into existence due to vacuum energy. Additionally, the Higgs field can't be removed. Even if we ignore every kind of field and particle except electrons, protons and neutrons, we find that atoms are still not empty. Atoms are filled with electrons. It's true that a large percentage of the atom's mass is concentrated in its tiny nucleus, but that does not imply that the rest of the atom is empty. Rather, it implies that the rest of the atom has relatively low density. The misconception of an empty atom is taught by incorrect elementary-level science books and is based on the false picture of electrons as balls. In this view, the atom consists of electron balls whizzing around the atomic nucleus which is itself a ball. In this picture, the space between the electrons and the nucleus is therefore empty space. While this picture (the Bohr model) is simple to imagine, it was shown to be wrong almost a century ago. Electrons (as well as all particles) are partially particle-like and partially wave-like, depending on the situation. When bound in atoms in an undisturbed state, electrons act like waves. These waves are three-dimensional probability density waves that spread out to fill the entire atom. The electrons do not spread out uniformly, but rather follow specific distribution patterns called \"orbitals\". The shape of the orbitals underpin all chemical reactions. As an example of some orbitals, the single-electron density distribution is shown on the right for hydrogen in the first few lowest states. The lighter points indicate regions where the electron has a higher density. Note that each image represents a single electron. The different light spots and bands in a single image are all part of a single electron's wave state. Because bound electrons spread out into fuzzy density waves, there is no definite \"edge\" to an atom. The electron actually spreads out to fill all space, although far away from the atom it is thin enough to be negligible. Interestingly, electrons in the atom even spread out so as to overlap with the nucleus itself. This electron-nucleus overlap makes possible the effect of electron capture, where a proton in the nucleus can react with an electron and turn into a neutron. If atoms were mostly empty space, we could remove this space and shrink atoms. In reality, atoms do not contain any empty space. Rather, they are filled completely with spread-out electrons, making the shrinking of atoms impossible.",

These galaxies emit radio waves at gigahertz frequencies, which makes them visible to radio telescopes operating at these frequencies.\n\nThe radio emission from GPS galaxies is believed to be produced by synchrotron radiation, which is emitted by electrons spiraling around magnetic field lines. This radiation can be observed across a range of frequencies, with the emission typically peaking in the gigahertz range.\n\nThe precise mechanism that produces the radio emission from GPS galaxies is not fully understood, but it is believed to be associated with jets of material ejected from the galaxy's central region. As the material in the jet interacts with the surrounding gas, shocks form and the electrons in the jet are accelerated to high energies, producing the synchrotron radiation that is observed at radio frequencies.",

Similarly, increasing the mass of an elastic material can cause it to deform in a nonlinear way, leading to differences in behavior that are not proportional to the increase in mass.

        "query": "Why can't flat lenses focus light?",
        "response": "Actually, flat lenses can focus light if they are built properly. Let us look at the basics of lenses and then at different types of flat lenses. A traditional lens is essentially a curved piece of glass that bends light through a process known as \"refraction\". Whenever a ray of light travels from one transparent material, such as air, into another transparent material, such as glass, it changes direction (except in the special case of the light's direction being perfectly perpendicular to the interface). This change of direction occurs right at the interface between the two materials, and not deep in one material. The light bends because one material has electrons that interact more strongly with the light passing through it than the other material, causing the light to slow down and bend. The ability of a material to bend light is quantified by its \"refractive index\". A material with a higher refractive index, such as diamond, will bend light more. When light goes from a standard low-index material (such as air) into a standard high-index material (such as glass), it always bends towards the normal to the surface. In contrast, when the light goes from a standard high-index material (such as glass) into a low-index material (such as air), it always bends away from the normal. This is illustrated in the diagram. If you look closely at the diagrams above, you will realize that if light enters one surface of glass and bends, and then exits a surface that is parallel to the first surface, it will bend back by the same amount and end up not bent at all. If we are using simple, standard, smooth, uniform pieces of glass, we have to curve one side of the glass so that the light remains somewhat bent upon exiting the piece of glass. This is how traditional lens are built: with one side (or both) curved. A concave lens is a lens that is thinner at the center than at the edges. If you follow the rays of light through a concave lens as I have done in the diagrams below, you find that a concave lens spreads out light. In contrast, a convex lens has a thicker center than its edges and tends to focus the light. A standard, flat, uniform piece of glass does indeed fail to focus or disperse the light, as can be seen in the rightmost diagram below. That is why we can look out of flat glass windows and see the outside world as it really is. But there are more things in the world than standard, flat, uniform pieces of glass. A Fresnel lens is an interesting object that starts with a convex shape and then has useless material removed until you have an object that is mostly flat but still retains the essential properties of a convex lens. Look closely at the middle diagram above of a standard convex lens. The bending of light happens entirely at the curved exit surface. Because the entrance surface is normal to all the rays, none of the light bends at this surface. We can therefore remove most of the glass material as long as we keep the entrance surface normal to the rays entering. This is accomplished by dividing the lens into sections and removing as much glass as possible from each section while still allowing the entrance surface to be normal to the entering rays. This process is shown in the diagram below. Lastly, all the different sections can be aligned in a flat plane to make the material savings worthwhile without affecting the focusing ability much. The result is an object that is virtually flat (although it is a little rough in an essential way), but is able to focus light just like a convex lens. The great advantage of a Fresnel lens is that you can make a huge lens that is still thin on average. Fresnel lenses are used in lighthouses to focus the light forwards, giving lighthouses their distinctive look. Fresnel lenses are also used in overhead projects, car headlamps, and emergency signal lights. You may complain that a Fresnel lens is not really flat, so it does not count. Fair enough. Let us move on to another type of lens that is really flat: the graded-index lens. If you remember, we discussed the fact that a higher-index material will bend light more. If we vary the index of refraction of the lens from its center to its edge instead of varying the normal direction by curving the surface, we can get the same kind of focusing effect. To make the refractive index of the material change as you go from its center to edge, you just have to gradually change the material. For instance, a graded-index lens can be made by stacking thin layers of slightly different types of glasses in a controlled way. The effect is shown in the diagram below. Graded-index lenses are used in scanners and photocopiers where the flat lens shape makes them easy to mount. You may still complain that a graded-index lens is indeed flat but not uniformly one material. A graded-index lens is, in a sense, many little lens made out of different material stuck together. Is there a lens that is both flat and uniform, and yet is still able to focus light? Amazingly the answer is yes, but you have to use non-standard materials. There is a special kind of man-made optical material known as \"meta-material\", \"left-handed material\", or \"negative-index material\". The interesting thing about meta-materials is that they not only refract light, they also flip light to the other side of the normal upon refraction. The situation is illustrated in the diagram below. This flip may seem trivial, but this behavior can lead to interesting results. For one thing, this property can be used to make cloaking devices. More to our point, though: a flat, uniform piece of meta-material can act just like a convex lens and is able to focus light. We can show this by tracing the light rays through a flat piece of meta-material, being careful to flip the rays across the normal as happens in real life. The result is shown below. Meta-materials do not occur in nature and they are hard to fabricate, so there are not yet many commercial applications using flat plates of meta-materials to focus light.",

Let us look first at the general issue of acquiring accurate information, and then apply it to the internet. An appeal to authority is a logical fallacy. In other words, statements such as, \"Dr. Smith says this idea is accurate, therefore this idea is accurate,\" cannot be guaranteed to be true all the time. Appealing to authority is therefore a weak method to determine the truth of an idea, and a weak argument to use in debate. The truth is more consistently arrived at through controlled and repeated experiments, as well as by applying rigid rules of logic and deduction. Unfortunately, an appeal to authority is often the only option available. Most of us don't have the time, training, or equipment to find the truth out for ourselves experimentally. For instance, personally determining whether most of the earth's oxygen comes from trees or from microscopic ocean plants is beyond the resources of most of us. We are often forced to rely on the word of somebody else. But there are still steps we can take when appealing to authority in order to optimize the rate at which we arrive at true information. 1. Personally conduct controlled experiments.The gold standard for establishing accurate information in science is repeatable, controlled experiments. Experimental results trump personal views almost every time. The beauty of science is that you don't have to trust another person's word that steel is ferromagnetic.

The other person could have done the experiment wrong, or misread the result, or lied to you. If at all possible, conduct experiments yourself to find out the truth. Do you know why the Wright brothers were the first ones to successfully fly an airplane? It was not because they were the first to try, nor because they were the only ones with the engineering expertise. At that time in history, the U. S. government had published incorrect aerodynamic coefficients. As a result, all the teams trying to build airplanes were using the incorrect numbers and, as a result, were building flightless airplanes. After many failures using the government's coefficients, the Wright brothers built a wind tunnel and personally measured the correct aerodynamic coefficients. The Wright brothers were the first to fly because they personally performed controlled experiments instead of relying on other people's experiments. Researchers in laboratories are quite familiar with this principle. The first thing a researcher does when he starts a new project and sets up a new experimental system is to try to reproduce the published results of others. If the researcher can't reproduce the results, either the new equipment is not calibrated properly, or the published experiments are faulty. The answer is found by repeating the experiment. Don't be tempted to skip this step because you don't have access to an expensive laboratory. There are many concepts you can determine for yourself right at home, such as whether baking soda burns in a fire or whether the tip of your tongue can only taste sweet flavors. This concept of personal investigation goes beyond basic science. If you want to know whether toothpaste takes off pen stains, try it! If you need to find the area of a circle with a radius of 10 inches, calculate it yourself instead of looking it up. The best way to see if a car has a smooth ride is to test-drive it yourself. The best way to see if a new shirt fits is to try it on. For this reason, the internet will never completely replace shopping. There's no need to trust others if you are able to make an evaluation yourself. The internet is not the only source of all knowledge. It is just a backup resource when in-person evaluation is impractical. Your experiments should be as scientifically sound as possible. You can ensure this by controlling extraneous variables, quantifying the result, blinding the test subjects, repeating the experiment, and averaging over many repeats. For example, swallowing an herbal supplement and then telling yourself, \"I feel stronger, therefore the pill made me stronger,\" is not very scientific. Such an approach will not be very successful in leading you to the truth. On the other hand, if you ingest a certain herbal supplement every morning, take your blood pressure every night for a month, calculate a running average of the numbers, and find your blood pressure steadily decreasing, then you would have a more convincing case that the herb is doing something. Be warned, however, that many experiments can be deadly. Investigating whether chlorine bleach cures an upset stomach could end up killing you. Even many over-the-counter herbal pills can put you in the hospital if taken too often or too long. If your experiment involves swallowing, dangerous chemicals, fuel, electricity, or heavy machinery, it's best to first check to see if anyone else has tried the experiment and lived to tell about it before trying it yourself. Often you don't have the expertise, equipment, or time to find an answer through your own experimentation. In that case, you must turn to others for answers, and we move on to the next steps. 2. If only non-expert opinion exists on the subject, go with your own opinion.\r\nYour next-door neighbor may be very animated and convincing, but unless he has a degree in physics and has done controlled experiments repeated by others, his views on time travel have the same worth as your own views. A time machine built according to his designs will work just as well as one built according to your own design (neither will probably work). Reading a lot of imaginative science fiction novels does not make him an expert. Reading popular science magazines and lay science books does not make him an expert. Tinkering in his basement also does not make him an expert. People become experts in a given field by getting a degree in that field, engaging with the corresponding professional community, and doing their own controlled experiments. Degrees matter because science is hard. It takes the pressure of homework, exams, and grades to push a student through the hard parts of science. Without a degree, a person may think they know a lot about a subject but in fact know very little because they have skipped the hard work needed for deep understanding. (Contrary to what you may have heard, Einstein had a PhD.) No matter how fervently your aunt believes that orange juice cures warts, or how many news reports she thinks she has read verifying this belief, going with your own opinion will lead you to the truth just as quickly as listening to hers. You are both equally non-expert, so you might as well go with your own uninformed intuition rather than her uninformed intuition. There are many voices on the internet, most of them non-expert. While discussion boards, blogs, and online comments can be fun, entertaining, cathartic, and even stimulating, be careful to not value the statements of others above your own opinions if they are not experts in the corresponding field. Note that the best options are still personal experimentation and turning to experts. You should only turn to your own uninformed notions when experts aren't available and personal experimentation is not an option. 3. Find an authority who is an expert on the specific subject at hand.\r\nIt should be clear at this point that truth is best obtained by turning to real experts, and not by turning to self-proclaimed experts, or non-experts. But being an expert is not enough. The authority should be an expert in the specific field that they are commenting on in order for their opinion to have weight. Being an expert in one field does not make you an expert in all fields. This mistake is made more often than you may realize because many people love to view their heroes as all-knowing beings. Being successful at boxing does not make a boxer an expert on the quality of kitchen appliances. And yet, the grills that a famous boxer recommends in advertisements are successful. Similarly, a pop singer may have a fine voice, but that does not qualify him to advise you on which nail polish works the best. Politicians may know a thing or two about elections, politics, and the law, but that in no way makes them a credible voice on climate science. This mistake even happens in the professional scientific community. For example, the renowned theoretical physicist Roger Penrose has written numerous books on neuro-biology, a subject he knows nothing about. Such books have no more weight than sheer speculation. Similarly, Linus Pauling won the Nobel prize for his work on the physics and chemistry of atomic bonds, but that does not make him an expert on nutrition. Pauling successfully launched the unscientific mega-vitamin health movement when in reality he knows very little about the subject. Being smart in one field does not make you know everything about every field. If your dentist tries to advise you on hair care, or your optometrist recommends certain shoe inserts, be warned that they have wandered into territory where their opinion is no better than your own. 4. Make sure the expert is unbiased.\r\nOnce you have found a genuine expert on the subject at hand, you still have to be careful that his words have merit. Bias tends to consciously or subconsciously propel experts away from the truth. When their motivation for speaking becomes something other than making the truth known, truth tends to suffer. The most obvious form of bias is a conflict of interest. A scientist hired by a cigarette company will make statements about the effects of smoking that the company wants him to say, and not those that are the most truthful. Any famous person who is hired to endorse a product is biased towards the product by his paycheck. His comments in a commercial are not his honest opinion of the quality of the product he is trying to sell, but are just the result of money talking. A famous boxer that is peddling grills is doubly unreliable as a voice on the quality of kitchen appliances; he is a non-expert, and he is biased by his paycheck. An expert can be biased even if he goes unpaid. A scientist studying the efficacy of a product that is made by a company in which he owns stock will care less about the truth. Scientists who are trying to sell you pills, workshop tickets, treatment plans, or books at the same time they are explaining a scientific principle are biased. Once you find a genuine, unbiased expert, go ahead and listen to what he has to say, but don't automatically believe everything he says. Statements that he makes which are direct reports of experimental results or come straight from science textbooks are the most likely to be true. Statements that sound more like hypothesizing, personal opinion, or speculation are less likely to be true. Sentences such as \"our results showed that doubling the length of the laser did not change its output power\" are more reliable than sentences such as \"the laser will revolutionize the robotics industry.\" 5. Check to make sure the expert's opinion matches the consensus of most experts, or at least seek out a second opinion.Even after making sure you have found a credible, unbiased expert, his words could still be in error. Experts are humans and humans make mistakes. With over six billion people on the planet, you can find many experts that are making false claims. That is why peer review is so crucial in science. The best way to minimize being misled by one expert is to seek out many experts. The very best path is to seek out the consensus of all scientists. For example, only one discredited scientist in a world filled with scientists claims that autism is caused by vaccines. The rest of the actual scientists in the world agree that autism is not caused by vaccines. Consensus does not mean that the doctors vote on their favorite idea and the one with the most votes wins. Consensus in science means that the idea with the most experiments to back it up is the most accepted one. If one researcher does an experiment and finds the result to be 700 Volts, but a dozen other independent researchers repeat the exact same experiment and find the result to be around 5000 Volts, then 5000 Volts is most likely to be the correct answer. In areas that are more specific, it is not always possible to collect a consensus because there are not enough researchers able to work on that specific problem. In such cases, it is still worthwhile to get a second and third expert opinion. In the world of journalism, this is summed up by the motto \"use multiple sources\". For instance, there is a consensus among medical doctors that diabetes is caused by abnormal blood sugar regulation. Because of this consensus, it is highly likely that this statement is true. On the other hand, there is not a consensus among medical doctors whether you personally have diabetes. Gaining such a consensus would require every doctor in the world to personally meet with you, perform a physical exam, and review your lab work. Such an approach is obviously impractical. Where a consensus is not attainable, the next best thing is a second opinion. The whole world may not be able to personally examine your health, but two or three different doctors certainly can. Doctors who value scientific truth more than their ego will even seek out a second opinion when considering a weighty diagnosis. This principle goes far beyond your health. You should read several different books and articles by independent sources on the same topic before considering a scientific statement valid. With the five steps to finding scientific truth now established, let us apply them to the internet. Searching for Accurate Scientific Information on the Internet 1. Personally conduct controlled experiments.\r\nSee if you can answer the question yourself before turning to the internet. 2. If only non-expert opinion exists on the subject, go with your own opinion.\r\nWhen you come across a website making scientific claims, check to see if the author is an expert. Use an independent website to check the author's credentials instead of trusting what the author himself claims. If the author is not an expert, then do not give very much weight to his comments. Again, an expert is someone who has a mainstream degree in the field he is commenting about and is actively engaged in research in this field. Note that sometimes a non-expert will carefully aggregate the claims of experts. In that case, the non-expert is not really making the claims, the experts are, so the claims have the high weight they deserve. But don't just trust the non-expert to quote the experts properly. You should go to the original source to verify the claims. For instance, science news websites contain the wisdom of experts, as gathered and summarized by non-experts. For this reason, science news websites may be highly reliable sources of science information, if you verify their claims by going to the original sources that they reference. Make sure that the documents that the science news article references are indeed by experts and indeed say what they are purported to say. Similarly, blogs that simply contain personal reflection essays by non-experts are highly unreliable. In contrast, blog articles written by experts and containing links to scholarly publications to back up their claims are far more reliable. In general, avoid places where non-experts tend to congregate if you want reliable scientific information, such as listed below. These places may be worth visiting for social enjoyment, entertainment, catharsis, or cutting edge news, but don't treat them as reliable sources of scientific facts. For accurate science information on the internet, avoid: 3. Find an authority who is an expert on the specific subject at hand.\r\nThe safest way to end up with a web page written by an expert in that specific subject is to go first to the following types of websites: 4. Make sure the expert is unbiased\r\nWhen seeking for reliable scientific information on the internet, avoid websites that use their information to try to sell you something. For example, if you want to learn about how the adrenal glands work, an internet search leads you to various sites. One of the sites looks professional and seems to contain sound scientific explanations about the adrenal gland. But a closer look reveals that just about every page and paragraph on this website is trying to sell you pills, oils, or books. These sales pitches should immediately tell you that the expert is biased and therefore his scientific information is unreliable. Even though the author of this website claims to be a doctor with all sorts of credentials, he is not motivated to tell you scientific truth. Rather, he is motivated to tell you anything he can think up that will persuade you to buy his product. This bias does not mean that every scientist salesman is evil, or is consciously telling lies, or is pushing products that are worthless. It just means that they can not be relied upon to provide accurate scientific information, because of their conscious or subconscious bias. Unfortunately, such websites can be dangerously persuasive, spreading misinformation as well as poverty and misery to those we fall prey to their \"remedies\" and falsehoods. 5. Check to make sure the expert's opinion matches the consensus of most experts, or at least seek out a second opinion.\r\nConsensus opinion is most readily found on the internet by following the tips below: In summary, the best way to find accurate scientific information on the internet is to: avoid non-expert opinions such as found in general discussion boards, forums, article comments, and popular media; find an expert in the appropriate field by using government, university, and academic journal websites; make sure the expert is unbiased and is not trying to sell you anything; and lastly, check that the statements of the expert match the consensus of other experts. If all this sounds like too much work, then you will have to get comfortable with half-truths. In life, finding the whole truth requires hard work, but can be very rewarding.",
