        "response": "This is a lot like the chicken and the egg; the seed didn't simply pop out of thin air as your fundie friend would assume. The earliest land plants reproduced with using spores which germinated into small gametophytes and produced sperm. This sperm would swim into the soil until it would find an ovule and form an embryo. This embryo would eventually grow into a sporophyte. Heterosporic plants produced spores of 2 sizes, micro and megaspores. Eventually, a single megaspore would get boxed into its sporangium while growing. The growing spore (now a megagametophyte) is contained within a tough outer protective layer. This is only one way that seeds were formed in plant life. There are several different evolutionary paths that ultimately converged into spermatophytes (seed plants).

Hopefully with most drugs the ratio between those two, the therapeutic index (ed50/ld50) will be far away from 1 so it's easy to give people the right level of drug. But there may also be a minimum toxic dose, hopefully above the minimum effective dose. If you raise the blood concentration of the drug above the minimum toxic dose then the person will start to have major side effects.

Even if you get your masses and orbital radii so that your, say, L2 point is inside the atmosphere of your object, some of your planetary mass is then on the other side of L2, which throws all the gravity off. Furthermore, it would be effectively useless as a stability point- so close to one body, the point would be tiny and the smallest move would send you off into the influence of one of the parent bodies.",

If you let this go on long enough, its orbit will presumably shrink enough to fall out of the resonance (maybe making the entire system of orbits unstable) and thus lose its source of tidal heating. I have no idea what kind of timescale this effect takes place on though, but it's evidently pretty long for us to still be seeing it. Tidal timescales are still a big mystery for most astronomical systems, but I think rocky systems tend to be worse at dissipating tidal energy than gas giants, so it's no surprise that Io's tidal heating isn't decaying its orbit too rapidly.",

        "response": "We sort of have a system similar to university. We have required classes, but sometimes get to choose when we take them. This is also sometimes true as early as sixth grade (11-12 year olds).  Say we need to take two years of math. This is determined on what level of comprehension we have. I took geometry as a first year high schooler, which allowed me to take second year algebra my sophomore year, a precalculus course my third year, and calculus 1 my fourth. This was above the requirements, as most students only take algebra, geometry, second year algebra, and sometimes precalculus or trigonometry. Usually only three years are required. We can also choose which sciences we take. Usually you're required to take biology, physics, and chemistry, but you may pick the order in which you take them, or decide if you want to take them concurrently. Taking multiple of these courses opens the possibility for upper level classes in the following semester (Honors, or advanced placement classes).",

To Marx, it meant a society where everyone was equal, where governments had withered away and capital was owned equitably by all, working by the rule of \"from each according to their ability, to each according to their need\". Communist parties are so named because they seek to work towards this end. Describing them as socialist is, however, fair. Socialist societies are defined by the fact that industry, and capital, are owned by labour, or representatives thereof. In the case of the Soviet Union, the government claimed to be representing labour. The amount to which they actually did can be debated, but I personally would describe the Soviet Union as socialist.",

Using the cardinal numbers of set theory, there are many different infinite values, but you still have x \\* 0 = 0 for any x, whether finite or infinite.

This is because when your eyes get used to seeing a specific image, it wears out the receptors in your eye that detect those particular colors, since they need a few moments to get back the neurotransmitters they use to send information on what you're seeing back to your brain. Since these light-detecting cells are \"tired out\" they struggle to react even when you move your eyes elsewhere. So if you see something red for a while, and then look at something white, you won't detect the red coming from that white light (since white is all colors of light) since your red-detectors are tired. So it looks instead like you are seeing something that has *no* red light, which makes it appear green to you at first.",

In most of those cases, point 2 below would be relevant. Besides that, I'd say that: 1. As you said, many drugs are not soluble in DMSO in relevant amounts. 2. Even if something *is* soluble in DMSO, if it has too high a molecular weight, it still will not be transported through the skin ([e.g. insulin](_URL_0_)). 2.

The computer is fast enough to count every wave, and when it hits 33000, the system will clank another second. Since quartz oscillator needs constant power to work, the time system works on individual power source to count the time even when the system is off. That's why we have batteries on our motherboards.

If the current is a boundary current, then a portion of the pressure gradient force can be supported by pressure against the solid earth. Essentially, geostrophic currents can 'lean' on continental shelves or deep ocean ridges. As those currents vary in time, there is a fluctuation in the net lateral force the current exerts on the bathymetric slope of the ocean margin.

The curtains will likely concentrate the heat at the curtain/window part of the room and so areas on the other side of the room could be significantly cooled by the lack of direct sunlight (even though average room temp would increase).

Originally train lines had red for stop and white for go with green meaning caution. Unfortunately, there was an accident when the lens fell out of one of the red lights (making it white) and so they removes the white colour and replaced it with green. The intermediate (caution) colour became yellow. When the lights were established in London, the same system was used. In part because it was familiar to officials who would implement the system but more because red is a great colour to penetrate London fogs. Longer wavelength light is scattered less by atmosphere and other gases so red penetrates better than green or yellow. Thus you can see a red light further away in fog than green.",

Thanksgiving is just a day when families put down whatever they are doing, and put aside whatever issues they have with each other and eat a meal together. It is only important because it is is viewed as a sort of social barometer for a family.

During Operation Barbarossa, Hitler personally interrupted the original plan by constantly diverting forces from one front to another multiple times which slowed down the main force, Center Group, that was tasked with capturing Moscow. Also during Operation Blau, Hitler put too much emphasis on the capture of Stalingrad which was originally meant to only help protect the flank of the main force that was advancing into the Caucasus. The number of forces that were diverted to participate in the battle of Stalingrad weakened the flanks enough for the Russians to counter attack across an ill-defended Don River which ultimately lead to the capture of a quarter-million men.

Then when they step onto the opposite leg they use hip flexion to swing it forward. It then kicks out and extends so they can land on it straight. People can get so good at it that only a PT can recognize the gait. This also allows the leg to bend naturally when the person sits (they control their descent with the good leg). There are many many ankle options out there, from the \"runner\" foot or blade to the pointed foot for dancers to a regular, nonflexible ankle and foot.

Nuremburg was unprecedented, especially the scale of the trials and the legal underpinning of the whole endeavor. (When saying \"Nuremberg,\" be sure to indicate which set of trials you mean since there were several. My assumption is that we are talking about the trials of the major war criminals -- the Nazi high command.)  In the past, victors had found easier solutions for dealing with the leadership of belligerent nations. For instance, Napoleon was exiled. After the First World War, there was a proposal to try Kaiser Wilhelm for war crimes, but he went into exile before this happened.  In Nuremberg, one of the principle charges was the new concept of \"Crimes against Humanity.\" While this was argued to be an ex post facto charge by the defendants, the victorious nations, particularly the U.S. and Justice Jackson, held that the crimes were so odious as to be understood as inherently illegal.",

        "response": "When scientists refer to the speed of light related to causality ( c ), what they are actually talking about is the speed of a massless particle (usually the photon). When you hear about the speed of light in a medium slowing down, what you are hearing about is the macro level appearance of moving light. The reason it slows down is because as photon move through the medium, they are periodically absorbed and re-emitted by atoms in the substance. This absorption takes time, so the light seems to take longer to move through it. Between atoms though, photons are always moving at c. In my opinion, 'speed of light in a substance' should always instead be called the speed of propagation of light in the substance instead, because they are two different things, and this does tend to confuse new people.

The \"A\" in \"dBA\" specifically indicates [A-Weighting](_URL_0_), which is a an adjustment applied to \"flat\" dB-SPL measurements to approximate the frequency sensitivity of the human ear. (Although A-weighting does have its inadequacies, we don't need to get into that here.) [Noise Induced Hearing Loss](_URL_1_) (NIHL) occurs when the hair cells in your cochlea are damaged as a result of over stimulation. Let's say we have a perfect pink noise signal, which is to say that the sound approaching your ears has equal energy at all octaves. After passing through your auditory system, this signal will create a greater vibration at the hair cells associated with the more sensitive frequency bands. Therefore the likelihood of damage to these hair cells, and hearing loss at the associated frequencies, is much greater.",

When the ground under the sidewalk settles the asphalt will crack apart much faster than the concrete will. Also, if I was wrong, think of white as an insulator and black as a conductor. White materials act as a closed door and keep heat from moving. Black materials act as an open door and let the heat come right in.

Air is an insulator, and lightning is what happens when the voltage difference between the cloud and the ground is high enough to get the electrons moving.

The main thing the civil rights campaigners were looking for was the idea of '1 man, 1 vote'. This is important as Protestant business owners often had more than 1 vote. Similarly, they sought an end to gerrymandering. The Protestants/Unionists, while being in the majority in Northern Ireland were (and still are) the minority when you take into account the Republic of Ireland's population. Therefore the Protestants in N.Ireland at the time of the civil rights movement, felt that any concessions to the civil rights campaign, might lead on the long run to a United Ireland and the erosion of their British identity.",

        "response": "There are a couple of problems with that idea: - Black holes are _really_ far away. The closest one we have found is Cygnus X-1, which is still 6,000 light years away. We simply don't have the technology to send something that far away yet. - Even if we could get there and we could send some signal back (a 12,000 year round trip is the best case scenario), we wouldn't learn anything useful. We can already observe black holes right up to the event horizon - the point beyond which the black hole begins to absorb everything. New data would have to be from inside the event horizon, wherein lies the problem - it absorbs nearly _everything_. There would be no way to get signal back outside to send back to us.",

        "response": "Contributors to stamina: Blood flow, how easily does your blood flow. Ease of blood flow contributes to stamina. Oxygen intake and efficiency. How much oxygen can your body intake and use, what's the efficiency of the usage, intake vs usage. Build up of lactic acid. Lactic acid causes muscle fatigue and soreness. How much lactic acid builds up in your muscles when you exercise.  These three factors contribute to your stamina and ability to perform exercise, or endure long bouts of physical activity. Each one of these factors can be increased or strengthened through exercise.",

        "response": "Saw no one had chimed in but I got curious and did a little digging. I found this from some yahoo thread asking the same thing several years ago: \"Yes. CIPA is a genetic mutation which prevents the development of cells which carry the electrical signals for pain, heat and cold to the brain. Pleasure is mainly derived from the body releasing dopamine, not from your nerves. For instance, when someone you have strong feelings for touches your arm, its not the touching that makes you feel good, its the fact that its someone special, your body releases dopamine as a way trying to keep you calm. Sexual pleasure is from a stimulation of a large cluster of nerves in a single spot. CIPA does not affect this, just like it doesn't affect pressure or touch. Having CIPA does not mean you are numb, you just have the inability to feel pain, heat or cold.\"",

        "query": "How does printing a receipt from a cash register work? What kind of file is a receipt?",
        "response": "A typical receipt printer itself has just enough memory to store an array of 1s (print here) or 0s (don't print here) to store a character, or potentially even a line (could be 8 dots high; 40 or 80 dots across). Like a litebright board, one character at a time. More sophisticated printers would have capacity for more lines. Whether it's a thermal receipt printer, or an impact/contact printer, the print head has those same matrix of positions that can be a 1 (make a dot) or a 0 (don't make a dot). So, it's usually what the printer is attached to that converts what numbers to print, to a simple array of dots that represent our visual interpretation of that data. No specific file type; just a matrix in memory, generated by the language of the register itself, in real-time, as-needed.",

        "response": "In general, as others have suggested, no. However, their longest nerve cells may be considerably longer than ours, depending on how far they need to reach from their spinal cords. The greatest distance ours travel is from our spines to the end of our toes, however in whales it's probably from their spines to the front of their bellies. I imagine some of their nerves cells might be several metres long, in that case.",

        "response": "In the US, originally, the rating system had an \"X\" rating for movies that either did not meet criteria to be rated at \"R\" (which was meant for mature audiences and not for children) or not rated at all. Few movies took the \"X\" rating because it meant that most theaters would not distribute the film, making the production company less money. This did not hold true for porn films, as they were never rated to be widely released. All were by virtue of this, rated X. Then, I want to say in the 1970s, porn companies took the rating as a sarcastic way of marketing their content, since a couple of US movies gained critical acclaim while also being rated X (Midnight Cowboy even won an OSCAR with the rating intact). They started marketing their films as \"XXX\" in a way to say, \"Hey, we're so far beyond what the rating board will allow, we're TRIPLE that limit.\" That's more or less how the XXX thing started, though I may be leaving some parts out through my own bad memory.",
