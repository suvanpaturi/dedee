That way on average, they can still make a profit on the item, even though on some consumers they lose money.    * Probably not in this case, but possibly loss leaders: Stores often are willing to sell some things at a loss, in order to get people to come in & then hopefully buy other things that they sell at a profit.

        "response": "I can't speak for the physical side of things. But I can tell you as a historian who primarily uses primary sources for research it's rather difficult to ensure that your diary will be a valuable resource for future historians. Although I admit I find it funny as I often have similar thoughts.  Generally speaking, much of what is used as primary sources today is, to put it simply, junk or trash. For example, there is a very talented historian at Rice University named Tani Barlow that does a lot of research exploring the depiction of women in Chinese ads in the 20s. It's fascinating work but the majority of her work uses sources that most people at the time would have considered completely irrelevant or uninteresting. However, they are valuable windows into the cultural space of the time period she studies. So even if your current writing may seem useless or irrelevant to future historians it may in fact be useful. At the very least, preserving such things will certainly be interesting to your descendants.",

Energy in food intake is also measured in this way, though the terms kilocalorie and calorie are often used interchangably, which can cause confusion.

Acetyl-phosphate is a candidate phosphate carrier for primordial metabolism, for example. _URL_0_ Edited to add: also, the third phosphate bond in ATP is often called a \"high energy\" bond, but really it's near the middle of bond energies common in biological systems. That people call it high energy is a pet peeve of mine: like most things in evolution, this phosphate bond is \"high *enough* energy\". A stronger bond would be more challenging to build in the first place, and a weaker one would mean cells would have to carry and circulate a much larger (perhaps prohibitive) volume of energy currency.

By the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, you know that you can not confine the r position of an electron. The energy eigenstates are associated with probability distributions in space.  If you were to measure the r position of an electron you have collapsed it into an eigenstate of radial position from which it can deviate with time in a derivable manner. Until you have measured this radius, however, it is still in a superposition of many radii so talking about its movement in space is almost nonsensical because you don't know where it is until it is measured. I hope this sheds some light. The flaw in your question isn't in your thinking, it's in the Bohr model of the atom.

However, if there really isn't that much protein available in the foraging range of the colony (which varies with ant species and colony size), it doesn't matter how much sugar you give them, they still won't be able to develop an indefinite number of workers.",

It's kind of like the potential energy of the nucleus. Nuclear binding energy is largest in iron, and is lower in both lighter and heavier elements. This means that, if you fuse atoms lighter than iron, you'll get a product with a higher energy requirement to break apart the nucleus. But since energy is conserved, extra energy is released that balances out the difference in binding energies between the source atoms, and the product. If you go in the other direction, splitting apart elements heavier than iron results in products that have a combined binding energy that is higher than the starting atom, and so once again, energy is released.

I\u2019m not really sure how valid of an estimation this is, as I understand it dynamo theory says the liquid iron motion itself is what causes the field, not the current through the liquid.

The Persians had more wealth and culture, so they tended to make the Arabs more Persian than the converse. A good example of this is when al-Mansour built Baghdad in the 760s.

However, some oil is in shale which is more like a rock sponge. Unlike a sponge you can't squeeze it to get the liquid out.  So to get the oil out you need to break all the tiny spaces in the shale to create one big hole that allows a large amount of liquid oil to flow.  The oil in shale was mostly discovered long, long ago, but no one could get to the oil in ways that cost less than the oil (drilling an oil well is very expensive).  Recently, we got better at angled drilling and can drill one well and extend holes in pinwheels away from the center and use a liquid to fracture an enormous amount of the shale around the well, which releases the oil trapped in it and allows it to be collected.",

        "response": "I would attribute it to them knowing the tiny differences and being extremely sensitive to them. Remember their eyesight is key, so being able to resolve minute details that you aren't keen to is on their list of advantages they have. Even without that, animals are generally very acute at recognizing members of their own species. Sheep know every other member of their flock even though their eyesight is poor compared to birds and they can easily look identical to any other animal. Like humans they actually have entire specialized sections of their brain dedicated to resolving each other. Birds in general have less complex social neurology and rely on \"sign stimuli\", so for instance the bird you mentioned with sexually dimorphic eye color would first identify the shape of the bird as one I'd itsown, and then look at the eyes (red hues are extremely pronounced in birds who scavenge, so this would be glaring to them) in order to determine the rest of their behavior.

        "response": "Caffeine shuts down the part of your brain that produces \"I'm Tired\" hormones. The first stage of tolerance is when your body makes more \"I'm Tired\" hormone factories, requiring more Caffeine to shut them all down.  Cut the Caffeine and now you've got all these extra factories putting out twice as much than the norm making you tired all the time. Stay clean for a couple of weeks and things will regulate.  It's possible that with excessive use over time, your body has just given up, stopped making new factories, and shut down the others. This would make it hard to sleep, and will likely take longer to regulate.  However, you should also do some navel gazing to see if Caffeine is the true problem. Are you stressed and not sleeping? Is your diet screwed up? Not getting enough exercise?  Caffeine is a short-term supplement. If you \"require\" it to start your day, it's time to cut it out and reset your system.",

We know what the end result of the infinite series is, so we don't need to demonstrate each individual integer. It works in the same way with the infinite amount of numbers between any two integers; we know what the end result is, so we don't need to show everything in between to get there. Or if you want to think about it more logically: - The difference between any two integers is a tangible form of maths, i.e. the difference between two apples and three apples is one apple. The difference is not the sum of an infinite number of infinitely small fractions of an apple, even though it logically could be.  The fact that we can separate an integer into an infinite number of infinitely small fractions is a practicality, rather than a requirement to reach the next number.",

Because a point charge gives off a radial field, any integral of flux across a closed surface containing a point charge will be proportional to the charge contained within (gauss's law), you should draw some pictures and try and intuitively get why this is true. The divergence theorem says the volume integral of the divergence of a equals the integral of flux across the surface of said volume, so the volume integral of the divergence is also proportional to the contained charge. Then differentiate both sides with respect to volume, and you can see that the divergence is equal to the charge per volume, or charge density.",

The reason that it's not instantaneous is that the marbles are not, in fact, perfectly rigid. They flex and bend (not much and very quickly). When you push marble A, it very slightly compresses the marble as it pushes against marble B, which slightly compresses and pushes against marble C, etc, etc. This pressure wave travels the whole way down to the last marble, which moves and allows the other marbles to relax.",

A 'skipped beat' is actually due to a cardiac event referred to as a Premature ventricular contraction (PVC), in which a beat occurs before it would be expected in normal sinus rhythm. This PVC is then followed by a compensatory pause as the heart returns to sinus rhythm, causing one to feel a 'skipped beat'. In cases of extreme stress, there is increased activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, which in turn causes an increase in systemic catecholamines (ie epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine). Epinephrine will bind to B1 receptors on the heart to increase the influx of Calcium, causing enhanced electrical activity in the heart and predisposing one to have a PVC. In some cases, the increase in catecholamines can be so great that it actually causes a series of symptoms similar to a heart attack in what is referred to as takotsubo cardiomyopathy.

Stored within a microprocessor located on a chip embedded in the card If a credit card is located within a wallet, it's safe to say that interception via #1 is impossible straight off the bat. Interception via #2 requires that the magnetic strip be exposed as the sensor needs to be incredibly close to it, and must scan across it cleanly. Interception via #3 is impossible because there's no way to get the credit card information from the EMV chip. How it works is far beyond the scope of ELI5, but the entire transaction is encrypted; furthermore, transactions beyond a certain value are further authenticated with a PIN known only to the card holder.",

No; for one thing, even among soldiers that received the death sentence, I am aware of no soldiers, certainly in the Franco-British forces, that flat out refused to go over the top, with the exception of the French Army Mutinies in 1917, and that did not result in mass shootings.

Hunger is a sensation caused by your brain when it detects that your immediately available energy (a chemical called glucose) doesn't match up to how much it thinks you need for your current activity rate. When you sleep, you aren't very active, and your body can get by on reserves of energy (a chemical called glycogen, stored in the liver) that take longer to convert into useful energy. Immediately after you wake up, you're still in a restful state, so your brain doesn't think it needs to tell you to get more food.  Once you've gotten up and started your morning routine, you might find that you begin to feel hungry again as you become more active, and your brain starts to realise that you will soon be needing more energy.

        "response": "I'm not sure about all antacid pills, but at least most of them are not simply an alkaline substance to cancel out the acid. They are a buffer substance where the active ingredients form conjugate acid/base pairs. So they work by normalising your acidity level to a pH very close to the equilibrium point of the buffer solution. If you have excess acid, the buffer solution's equilibrium will shift as the conjugate base is \"used up;\" as this occurs, only minor shifts to the pH of the buffer solution are seen. This is the same for a shift in either direction of the equilibrium until all of one of the acid/base pairs are gone and the buffer solution breaks down.  So taking large amounts of antacids would simply create a very robust buffer solution in your stomach at whatever the pH is at equilibrium of that solution. depending on the ingredients used, they might have other laxative effects or something like that, but nothing major would occur unless you managed to take enough to poison yourself.",

It was done with a great amount of planning and precision and they were able to take out the targets without harming the city. The citizens of Venice watched the raid from their rooftops.

That being said, it can be concluded that even if LSD somehow crossed the blood-brain-barrier and entered your CSF (cerebrospinal fluid), it's metabolism is so rapid that it would not be there for any relevant period of time. Leading theories on the phenomenon of \"flashbacks\" point to 2 possible major causes: #1) The flashback is similar to PTSD (fear conditioning) where the user had a \"bad trip\" and certain cues later on in life can bring the person back to that trip. This would be facilitated by your memory circuits in the hippocampal region of the brain. #2) Use of LSD inhibits and/or activates certain neurons, which when stimulated, can give the impression that one is \"tripping\" again. This isn't because the drug is still in your system, but is because the drug has modified receptors in the brain permanently.

By MrPaleontologist \u2022 4y \"Here's an explanation I learned in an animal behavior course - it's called a redirected attack. Animals do it, just like us. Basically, when we get angry at another person, we have the urge to attack them in some way. But for a variety of reasons (including that attacks are energetically costly and that actual attacks can shatter social bonds) it's actually more adaptive to redirect the attack at some other object. Thus, if I get furious at you, I'll most likely slam my hand on the table or smash something instead of punching you in the jaw and smashing your skull. Gulls have been observed to do this in territorial disputes. Instead of attacking each other, they usually will violently pull grass out of the ground in a manner similar to how they behave if in a physical confrontation.\"  I hope this helps.",

The only leverage they have is if they authorities believe they will kill hostages, a more serious crime than anything they are likely facing.

As opposing momentums cancel and similar momentums combine, the cloud gradually develops a spin which reinforces itself by first accelerating the surrounding orbiting particles into having a complementary momentum, and then pulling them into an impact which adds to the angular momentum of the disc. After a stellar object (and an accretion disc) have built up this angular momentum, its orientation is very resistant to being changed, exactly like a gyroscope's (and why we put rifling in our guns to make bullets spin when they are shot out). The orientation can change, though, similarly to how there's a precession in the Earth's rotation. It just takes enormous forces to do so.",

But when you haven't eaten, it does smething called a migrating motility complex, where it pushes food from the start of the intestines to the end. It basically picks up scraps that you left behind.  During this movement, gases and liquids move around in your intestines, which cause the rumbling sound.

You would have to pick de / d' if you were well-to-do, and it is likely the relatively elite who would take up the custom of surnames first, then the middling merchant class, then the peasantry.

That's also why judges are only referred to as your honor during court, as opposed to when they're just wandering around in public (unlike something like the title of doctor, where the respect is seen as something personal and inherent to the doctor). Now obviously the American legal system is not a representation of Elizabeth, but we kind of branched into representing a more abstract notion of justice, so we still use your honor.

        "response": "A class of chemicals known as sulphomanides were the first antibiotics to be discovered and used in a systematic way. They were derived from a drug called Protosil, discovered by the Bayer Corporation in 1932. This was actually a red dye, which had no effect on bacteria outside of a living organism. Inside one, the dye was broken down into several molecules, one of which had the antibiotic effect. This molecule was isolated, and called Sulphanilimide. Powdered Sulphanilimide was used as an antibiotic during WW2, especially in combat situations, as you mention. It's use greatly reduced the risk of infection from wounds. As it's systematic name is too complicated for daily use, it was commonly shortened to Sulfa. Nowadays, penicillin derivatives and similar chemicals are used for the same purpose, but these were not commonly available at the time. The method for mass-producing penicillin was only discovered in 1941, and even this produced a low yield compared to modern techniques.",

        "response": "The short answer is: It doesn't. At least not directly into the wind. You can sail close to the direction of the wind.  The wind on the sail acts a bit like a wing on a plane. The wind flowing over the back of the sale moves faster than the front, which creates lift. This lift will push the boat forward and sideways.  The force pushing you sideways is very strong, so you have a keel under the boat. This goes down under the boat and is filled with lead weights to keep the boat from tipping. The end result is the boat leans quite a bit, but doesn't tip, and moves forward. If you wanted to go directly into the wind you couldn't. Instead you would tack. It would look like a zig zag pattern, with overall progressing heading into the wind, but never sailing directly at it. Imagine switchbacks up a mountain.

        "response": "It would be nearly impossible to get it done in a reasonable amount of time if they started from scratch. The first rule of programming is don't redo someone else's work if you don't have to- it's a waste of time. That's why you see so many games these days use [Epic's Unreal Engine](_URL_0_). One person does the work once to make the engine, and they design it in such a way that they can improve it as the hardware improves. Valve's Source engine is just a variant of the Quake engine that they've been improving for almost 20 years. In the case of Grand Theft Auto, it looks like Rockstar built their own engine that they've been using and improving for the last 8 years, and they'll most likely continue to use it for a while.",

        "response": "The current theory is that it began as a similar virus infecting apes in Africa. A person (or possibly several people on several occasions) got some of the ape blood into theirs (perhaps by cutting themselves while butchering an ape for food) and had the misfortune to be susceptible.  From there, it has spread to almost all corners of the Earth by sexual transmission, or by blood to blood contact (sharing needles, or even having someone's blood on an open cut).  HIV replicates insides it's victim's cells, eventually causing AIDS, where a person's immune system is increasingly damaged, so that they cannot fight off other infections and eventually die. However, there are many new drugs which help suppress the disease in many people, allowing them to live rather long and healthy lives.",

The Obama administration has said it will not pursue MJ cases in states where it has been legalized, as long as it's done in accordance with state laws. This position is non-binding and could change at any time and might change with the next president. One thing that the states have done, in order to keep things from pissing off the feds and other states is require all MJ to be produced and consumed within state boundaries. Transportation of drugs across state lines, even if both states allow them, becomes a major federal issue.",

        "response": "Medical Student here. I believe this has to do with a type of nerve called nociceptors. These are essentially sensory neurons that sense a variety of things, such as thermal stimulus. Nociceptors can be \"upregulated\" that is, they can become more sensitive when they are exposed to certain conditions, such as the cold, meaning that when another stimuli is presented, such as warm water, the nociceptors are more sensitive towards it, causing it to be a greater response.  This is not a completely accurate response, but the mechanisms behind nociceptors can become rather complicated. TLDR; Nerves become more sensitive when they're activated. Hot water causes the sensitive nerves to over react.",

There is two phenomenon that happen, which will explain how you perceive it. 1) Our eyes can detect a portion of light wavelenght. We call that visible light, but the wavelenght themselves have no special value except that our eye can see them. We can see red, but not infrared. 2) Everything with energy emit electromagnetic waves as radiation. That wavelenght that any object emit depend on it's temperature. Look at your oven heating element. It's glowing red because it reach a specific temperature so it radiate in dark red. A fire have a higher temperature so it radiate orange/red. A plasma torch have an even higher temperature and will look blue. Well the same thing happen with object colder. At room temperature object still have energy that they radiate, but they radiate in the infrared. That's why we think of infrared as the heat signature, because you can see the infrared that everyday object and people emits.",

For example, in the sentence \"**I** gave **him** a taco\", \"I\" is the subject of the sentence (the person/thing that is performing the action) and \"him\" is the object (the person/thing being acted upon). So we use *who* in the sentence \"**Who** gave **you** a taco?\" (because the *who* is the active role and *you* is the passive role), whereas we use *whom* in the sentence \"To **whom** did **you** give a taco?\" (because the *you* is the active role and *whom* is the passive role). **tl;dr**: use **who** to replace *I/you/he/she/they/we* and **whom** to replace *me/you/him/her/them/us*.  edit:fixed stupid typo.

Likewise, a cube and an octahedron are dual and both have 11 distinct nets. The tetrahedron is self-dual, so we don't get an interesting result here. (It has 2 distinct nets.)

Maple syrup is mostly sugar water, which is not very conductive, but there would also be other ions and minerals in the syrup since the sap is the \"blood\" of the tree so it contains all the necessary chemicals for survival.  I think a bigger drawback is the price of maple syrup, due to the monopoly controlled by the quebec union of producers",
