The first was the need to stop the flow of communism by making the economies and general power structure of European countries stable. However, I think the second, and possibly more important, factor was that the Americans weren't being generous at all. They knew that this was a great deal for them. They were loaning out money to countries and the money came right back to us. The industrial powers of the world were devastated by WWII. Really, the US was the only one left standing. Europeans were dependent on the US for food, industrial goods, and even the means to begin producing again. This is one of the major causes of the post-war boom in US production and wealth. However, these countries could only afford to do this if they had the money and economy to do so. Basically we were funding a stimulus bill of sorts based on international trade. edit: grammar",

The steps per second a computer does is usually written as Gigahertz (GHz), with 1 GHz equal to 1,000,000,000 steps per second. Now overclocking is telling the computer to do more steps per second. That means it gets things done faster, but it also uses more energy and makes it hotter (just like if you try to walk faster).  If you try to force it to go too fast then sometimes the power supply can't give it enough electricity, or it gets too hot, and it crashes. Running a computer hotter for long periods of time can make it wear out faster too.",

However, the reality is that several species of trees can grow quite well without irrigation even in the Palliser Triangle which is one of the more severe prairie environments. This has been demonstrated by a number of forestry test plots (the one that pops to mind is near Caron, SK). Historically, though (and here I can't provide you with a reference), the fire cycle didn't permit forests from being established in the area since it is semi-arid (as noted in A_1337's response). So, I think it is important to note rainfall is sufficient to establish forests but other environmental factors (high wind, lack of natural fire breaks, high temperature in summer) contribute to a fire cycle frequency which favours grassland ecology over forest ecology.",

The **eccentricity** is a measure of the departure of this ellipse from circularity. The shape of the Earth's orbit varies in time between nearly circular (low eccentricity of 0.005) and mildly elliptical (high eccentricity of 0.058) with the mean eccentricity of 0.028. If the Earth were the only planet orbiting our Sun, the eccentricity of its orbit would not perceptibly vary even over a period of a million years. The Earth's eccentricity varies primarily due to interactions with the gravitational fields of Jupiter and Saturn. The inclination of Earth's orbit drifts up and down relative to its present orbit periodically due to these gravitational fields. One of the effects of these cycles is the tilt of the axis.",

This is actually a good thing - fluorapatite is much harder than hydroxyapatite, and resists corrosion from acids better. That *does* help protect the calcium you still have left, though. You're not replenishing your calcium, you're replenishing your enamel.  Importantly, this only works as the hydroxyapatite is breaking down. The component chemicals have to be present to reform into enamel, which is why once your enamel is gone, it stays gone. It's a bit like fixing a hole in a brick wall with new, stronger brick, but you didn't bring your own cement so you can only use the cement that's there and when that's gone the hole can't be patched.",

If you are, as me, a citizen of the german-speaking part of Switzerland, you will basically never need to speak italian or such.** We have to learn two languages at least in School, though (EN and French for me, EN/FR/IT in the extreme). The main part where all languages meet is national politics. It may help that Switzerland is so small. Our National Council offers simultaneous translations in all languages and the speaker speaks in his mother tongue. The Senate, however, does *not* offer this service. In conclusion. The main solution is translations, translations, translations everywhere. Ama. ^Edit:Grammar",

        "response": "America's contribution was pretty much vital in terms of the war finishing in 1918. From the point of view of the Western Allies, things were actually looking quite bleak in 1917. For one, the French Army (who had shouldered most of the burden on the Western Front) was nearing breaking point (something that resulted in mutinies amongst the troops) and the British offensive around Passchendaele didn't appear to be getting off to the best of the starts. However, the real strategic problem was that Germany made peace with Russia following the revolution and this freed up enormous amounts of manpower that could then be used to shore up the Western Front. Thankfully for the Allies, this development coincided with America's entry to the war so that most of Germany's strategic advantage was neutralised by the flood of American troops arriving in Europe. Had they not, it's conceivable that the fighting on the Western Front could have carried on grinding away inconclusively for years to come.",

(Another reason to not eat the yellow snow) Usually it varies from animal to animal. Polar bears for instance use a chemical process to help break down fat into water. That's why seals are the main course, they strip the blubber off and leave the meat to the scavengers. Penguins on the opposite end are designed with drinking salt water in mind. A gland behind their eyes filters the salt out of their blood and expels it through their nose. So there's no catch all answer, but usually A) they extract enough water from what they eat B) They adapt to drinking saltwater, which usually doesn't freeze in subzero conditions",

This means that you're not likely to fall over, since you're heading in a straight line at a significant speed, but it also makes turning harder.

They had the right to station troops in china to protect japanese merchants, whom enjoyed special legal status in china. The treaties were based on treaties that other great powers had made china sign.  When war broke out, Japan claimed its troops, who were legally allowed in china, had been attacked by chinese. So Japanese people were told it was a war of self defense.  There was a culture within the military that let atrocities happen. Physical beatings were common punishment in the imperial japanese military. Soldiers were not taught anything about ethical treatment of prisoners.  facing regular guerrilla attacks, they treated every single chinese as an enemy.  And officers rarely punished soldiers who brutalized civilians. It was a situation that allowed soldiers to engage in extreme acts of violence against helpless prisoners and civilians.",

However you can also define it in terms of electrons, hydrogen or oxidation number and I\u2019m sure there are others but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll need those to answer the question.  Basically when things are oxidised you are forming a new compound and that new compound will have different properties. To take the example of rust, you take a metal and now have turned it into an ionic compound which will cause it to have a new structure. The new molecule will have a new colour as different wavelengths of light will be reflected (something to do with how the electrostatic forces affect light, I\u2019m no expert). The fire thing is because many redox reactions reactions are exothermic (give off heat) and if enough heat energy is given off you can get fire.

If you have vigorous sex several times per day, it will burn calories, but it's unlikely to be enough to lose a significant amount of weight.  As with all of these types of questions: the ONLY way to lose weight is to burn more calories than you consume. Diets, pills, and supplements that claim to be able to boost your metabolism enough to cause you to lose more weight are lying. Your weight is 85% what you eat, and about 15% your exercise.

There has to be the right combination of both heat and kinetic energy to set off a block of C4. To get rid of a bunch of C4, you can hit it with a powerful blast of water that will (hopefully) tear apart the block of explosive without actually setting it off. You can also (hopefully) blast away the cap so that if it goes off, it's away from the bulk of the high explosive and (hopefully) won't set off much, if any. If there's a complicated trigger on the explosive, depending on how the explosive is detonated, you can put a shaped charge on the trigger and (hopefully) blow up the trigger without setting off the bomb itself.

As for the Moon, there are undoubtedly chunks of the Earth that that have landed on the Moon. In fact, if I'm not mistaken, the most commonly accepted theory of the moon's formation says that the moon is a chunk of the Earth. The idea is that some proto-planet smaller than the early Earth crashed into the Earth and the collision tore the Earth open, ejecting a bunch of the magma inside out into space. The debris from the collision and the magma ejected out eventually coalesced into the Moon we know today. So, in a weird sense, the Moon IS an Earth origin meteorite.",

The reason it is reactivated is not clear: herpes is usually dormant for awhile after infection then spontaneously pops up due to signals we don't entirely understand. It can cause sore on just about any place with lots of nerves or weak tissue, so it can get in the eyes or on the fingers.  But as for the reason it doesn't spontaneously shift it is likely the same reason you don't immediately get cold sores after your first infection: newly infectious virus particles don't cause immediate symptoms, and you already have antibodies and a latent infection.

All antidepressants work by increasing the levels of these chemicals in the brain, by different mechanisms. Most evidence suggests serotonin is the most important neurotransmitter involved in depression, although there are others such as noradrenaline and dopamine. Prozac (fluoxetine) belongs to group of antidepressants called SSRI's, or 'selective serotonin uptake inhibitors'. This means that is more selective for serotonin than older antidepressants were. It stops serotonin being reabsorbed when it is released, so it hangs around for longer and can have an effect for longer.",

So when something exciting happens, your brain triggers the gasoline (dopamine, epinephrine, serotonin) to release and it does things like make your heart go faster, make certain parts of your brain responsible for pleasure work harder, etc. We don't really know specifically why certain combinations of musical notes tend to do this for people but it has something to do with association of these combinations with memories that were created when we were very young. We know this because the musical notes that make people in the west feel stimulated are different than those that make people in eastern countries like Afghanistan and China.

At boiling point temperature, ALL the heat supplied will go into changing the state of the substance and this makes it easier to measure. This has other allied applications in chemistry such as calculating the bond energy of the substance.

In order to continue providing energy for the brain, your liver converts fat into molecules known as ketone bodies, which your brain can then use as an alternative energy source. Acetone is produced by the breakdown of ketone bodies for energy, and that's where the bad smell comes from.",

It will teach you both the writing system and the language, though it might seem like a bit much, and isn't particularly user friendly. I'd also recommend Snell's *A workbook of Cuneiform Signs* or something similar to practice the signs. You could alternatively use this in combination with a simpler, more user-friendly grammar, say Worthington's *Complete Babylonian*, which is actually incomplete because it doesn't teach the signs!
