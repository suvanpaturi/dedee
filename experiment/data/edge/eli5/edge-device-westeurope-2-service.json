You may sometimes hear the term \"white noise\" which means that the noise at every frequency (or wavelength) is the same. Similarly, we give the name \"white light\" to a set of wavelengths that have the same intensity over a given wavelength range (most often the visible wavelengths). That is to say if you were to measure how much green light compared to how much blue light there is in the spectrum of a truly *white* source, those numbers would be the same. We are often lazy with language and use 'white' light to mean light that contains all (visible) wavelengths, and loosen our restriction that the intensity at each wavelength must be the same. We often say the sun emits white light, but the truth is, the sun emits a continuous spectrum which peaks in the blue/green part of the spectrum - not truly *white* light.",

The tribes are clearly above the states, but Congress also has the right to modify agreements with them at will. The tribes have the right to their own foreign policy (in theory)-- which is why they declared war separately on the Axis powers. In addition, Congress will also often limit the application of bills to the tribes, and the larger tribes have their own legislatures and judicial branches. The Navajo, for example, are basically their own state, with territory the size of West Virginia and 250,000 on rez tribesmembers. However, Congress in the past has disbanded reservations entirely, so much of this basically works off of a system of mutual restraint, especially on Congress' side.

However, Voyager will continue to decelerate as it leaves the sun, and even after it is very far from the sun it will still be gravitationally bound to the galaxy, so it will never escape under its own power.

Shiites, on the other hand, believe that Mohammed chose his true successor to be his son-in-law, Ali, who was also the fourth Caliph.

Atlas Shrugged is more of a manifesto on her philosophy, which is essentially just pure selfishness. She believes that altruism, i.e. helping others, is evil. And that the only moral thing a person can do is care only for their own desires. It's frowned upon because that's the opinion of, at best, a very unpleasant person, and at worst, a dangerous psychopath.

That is, does this current situation look anything like a situation you've seen in the past? If so, what was the correct outcome in that past situation. The fast system tends to be focused on immediate consequences and is very vulnerable to biases and prejudices. The slower system is when you stop and think logically through a problem. It takes a lot more energy and time. This is often employed when you are confronted with an entirely new situation.

A really high fever is the body saying \"I'll kill this intruder or I'll die trying.\" Fevers don't outright kill intruders, but they do weaken them which helps your immune system fend them off. The reason you don't feel great when you have a fever is two fold: A) Your body is diverting all of it's energy to fighting whatever bug you have which means taking away energy from other places B) The biological processes in our bodies are suited to work best at body temperature. When that temperature is too high then those processes don't work as well.",

This is really more to do with a major high pressure system called the [Siberian High](_URL_0_) and Shanghai having a relatively humid climate.  Basically this high pressure system plays a huge role in weather across Asia and really the entire northern hemisphere bringing snow to places that otherwise would not see snow, generally where it meets tropical air in the Pacific Ocean. It's quite similar to what can sometimes happen on the east coast of the United States when polar air pushes the jet stream south and places as far south as Florida can see frost and rarely a snow storm, but the Siberian high is stronger and further south meaning that it affects Shanghai more regularly.",

The two were so intertwined that I don't think you could easily make the distinction between them. There is an old argument by Eric Williams in *Capitalism and Slavery* that sugar plantations spurred the Industrial Revolution in the late eighteenth century, and the capital from that allowed manufacturers to produce more goods which in turn led to trains and steamboats to transport them.

        "response": "Synaptic plasticity involved the up regulation and down regulation of certain synapses. NMDA is responsible for long term potentiation which is involved in the upregulation part of synaptic plasticity. High frequency activation of NMDA receptors greatly increase the concentration of calcium ions in the cell. The cell also goes through positive feedback and upregulates the amount of NMDA-Rs at the membrane, creating more responses in the future. However, NMDA can also act in the opposite direction with low frequency excitation (i.e. not enough to cause effects post-synaptically). This causes the receptors to be down regulated/internalised and causes long term depression. If you block NMDA, you stop both these processes and stop all neuroplasticity. Hope this helped.  If you want this in a paper: check out \"NMDA Receptor-Dependent Long-Term Potentiation and Long-Term Depression (LTP/LTD)\" by Luscher and Malenka. EDIT: forgot to say, I'm a pharmacology student.",

Anyone will wake up (and stay awake) if given enough painful stimuli (e.g., sternal rub, pinching, etc.).

In patients with a subarachnoid bleed, the rapid drop in pressure can also lead to worsening of the bleed. This is why (for example) many physicians prefer to get a CT of the head before doing an LP for suspected meningitis.  If hydrocephalus is the cause of the increased ICP, it can be relieved via a drain or shunt (with slow, controlled rates of removal).

Inductors are short circuits at low frequencies and open at high frequencies. A cap is the opposite. By putting them in series, you form a bandpass filter that shorts at low and high frequencies with a peak in the middle. Changing the capacitance with a varactor changes where that center frequency is.  Google \"analog filter design\" if you want more in depth information, because there is more nuance to it (how wide do you want the isolation? How much boost or cut?).",

Since we aren't looking to blast our signals in any particular direction, they get really quiet, really fast.

The premise is that extraterrestrial life has similar or better technology than us (and we can detect \"earth like\" or \"possible life\" planets in the galaxy), that they would detect that Earth is earth-like, and would blast it with radio signals to see if we can receive and respond to them. Such a radio blast, if enough energy were used, could easily travel a few hundred light years, but its still a very narrow window that we are looking at to try and detect alien life.",

When it hits the sink, it most likely happened because it dropped out of the tube from a height of a foot or so. That means that it hits with a good bit of force, and that forces squishes it into the porcelain surface. If you were to gentle squeeze it directly on the sink, you'd find that you could gently pick it up from there. Think about a human gently laying on a bed of nails versus a human landing on a solid concrete surface from a high fall. In the first case, the cohesive forces of the body are able to hold it together because not a lot of force is being applied and even though every individual every is small, it is spread out a lot.

The exception to this of course is when a seizure affects the midbrain and thus the occulomotor control goes out the window.

The reason it manifests in the way it does is that when it reactivates it reactivates along a nerve branch. On your skin we call this a dermatome. It simply means the area of skin innervated by a particular nerve branch. This is the reason the blisters happen in a patch. The virus has been reactivated in that dermatome. The reason for the blistering is that it goes from the nerve fiber endings into your dermis.

For a 2-D lattice, the Fourier transform of the diffraction pattern gives you a 2-D map of the electron density, which is essentially the locations of the atoms on the lattice. To get 3-D information, the sample is rotated and diffraction patterns are obtained for different angles, which can be correlated and have Fourier transforms applied to determine the 3-D lattice.",

An interesting complication is that the nature of the colliding objects and the medium in which they're colliding is involved. Obviously there's no sound in a vacuum so all the potential sound energy would probably be trapped as heat.

When you are trying hard for the first time, you are probably only firing like half your neurons and thus half your muscle fibers. Most gains at the beginning of a strength training program are made neurologically, as your brain learns to fire all of the neurons at the same time (even though we never fire them all, we can get a lot better than half). This is the biggest difference between muscles of the same size that are strong and weak. With similarly trained muscles of similar sizes, there are two anatomic differences that matter. Length of muscle/bone, and where the tendons attach. Those have to do with geometry of the situation, which is why people with short arms bench so much more than people with long arms.

This is an example of a [\"standing wave\"](_URL_0_). But the thickness that the layer has to be to create a standing wave is different for different colors of light. White light contains all different colors of light, though. Because the film is different thicknesses at different spots, different colors form standing waves at different spots depending on the thickness there.

These signatures are produced by the glow of the element itself, and by what wavelengths of light it absorbs at that temperature. So the color of a star tells us what it is made of and what temperature it is (at the surface). Estimating core temperatures is more complicated, and involves comparing the total thermal radiation at the surface, guessing changing composition of the planet with depth, etc. What we are really doing is quantifying how much total energy is within the object, then guessing at how concentrated that energy is. Temperature of nuclear reactions are far more accurate, if not simpler. Since we know exactly how much energy is produced by each type of reaction, on an atomic level, we simply apply that to the number of reactions expected to take place in a given time and volume. It's a bit more complex, but that's the crux of it.",

Grafting plants together, especially root-stocks to shoot-stocks is a very common practice.

Certain varieties of apple, pears, and quince may be mutually intercompatible by grafting. I have heard of pear-quince grafting, but I am not sure how apple fits in. They are all in closely related genuses in the family Rosaceae. A surprising one that works really well is potato-tomato grafting. Potatoes and tomatoes are closely related to each other and will graft successfully, producing rather poor tomatoes and rather poor potatoes, but it is interesting.

The process is involves also the underlying OS. The browser first sends the request to the OS. The OS checks its local store (eg: C:\\windows\\system32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts) and then sends the request to a remote DNS server (database). The DNS server may be at your ISP, or it may be public (eg: 8.8.8.8 Google DNS). The DNS server replies with the IP of the requested domain. Lists of domain names and IP addresses are maintained by the various domain registrars, and they are constantly aggregating with each other with any changes to IP/domains that occur.

Right off the bat I can come up with: - Ultrasounds emitted by bats are way higher pitched than phone lines cutoff frequencies - Echolocation is largely based on triangulation, and you cannot do that with a single sensor receiving the return signal (i'm talking about the microphone at the far end of the line): you need a spaced out array of at least two (in this case, the bat's ears, which BTW are far more sophisticated than normal ones) - Echo from the local phone hand piece would overwhelm every signal coming back - Bats can't use the phone EDIT: added a point about bat's ears",

        "response": "It's quite simple - it's not older than the universe, and nobody in astronomy is claiming that it is. Most of the articles and headlines that have claimed the star appears older than the universe just don't understand uncertainties. It's certainly an *old* star, but a more accurate headline would be \"age of star is consistent with age of the Universe\". Much less interesting though. ;-P",
