Everyone had a Proton, and other brands of cars were fairly rare or a luxury item. More recently (last 3-5 years) I've noticed more American/European cars.

Poisonous frogs are brightly colored so predators will see them and recognize the danger of eating them. Others, like birds, are brightly colored to be more attractive to mates (hence the males being bright while the females are dull). Mammals began to lose the need for those non-verbal, color-based communication. Scents and pheromones communicate fear or mating interest. Audible cues can convey warning messages. Additionally, mammals' color patterns can help them blend in to their enviroments, making hiding from predators, or sneaking up as a predator, easier. Rather than use bright colors, some mammals do use visual patterns. Zebras, cheetahs, skunks, etc, all have similar fur patterns, which helps identify them to other members of their species.",

We generate heat through our internal bodily processes and heat is exchanged between our body and the surroundings through a combination of processes, conduction, convection, radiation, respiration, and evaporation (of sweat).

Before cooking food we would probably have eaten the meat on the spot, which would have eliminated many of the threats we face from raw meat. However, wild carnivores are at high risk for parasites from eating raw meat, and presumably humans would also have been at risk. Cooked meat, and food in general, may actually be the reason why we grew larger brains. Cooking food \"pre-digests\" it, which means that our digestive system has an easier time extracting energy from food.

The most common type of baldness is male pattern baldness, which affects only the top part of the scalp. There is a hormone in your body called DHT that over time will stop the follicles on top of your head from growing hair (when you suffer from male pattern baldness). All of the hair follicles in your scalp get exposed to it, but the ones on the side and back of your head are resistant to its effects.  This is why when you take a hair follicle from elsewhere on the body (like the back of your head) and transplant it to the top of your head, it won't eventually stop growing hair like the original follicle did. Even though it's been moved, it is still resistant to DHT. There are a lot of other factors involved and other types of baldness, but that is a simplified explanation of what's going on.",

Heavy metal poisoning generally refers to lead, cadmium, mercury, and arsenic. your body CAN excrete zinc, copper, and iron, and of course you need a certain amount of these metals in your body to live. Iron is a very important part of your blood, so you don't die.  A distinction must be made between normal dietary levels of these metals, chronic toxic levels, acute toxic levels, and excretion disorders.  Copper, Zinc, and Iron have very *low* toxicity, so you really need a heck of a lot of iron (or copper or zinc) *or* an abnormality in how your body disposes of excess metal.

One of the most famous examples of binaurual audio is the \"Virtual haircut\" clip _URL_1_ where they demo a technology designed to create the effect. Lots of ASMR artists and other people do it too, one popular device these days is [a 3Dio twin mic setup such as this](_URL_0_).

Kinda like how 2x+1=5 allows just one value of x, except that these equations are considerably more complex (although not THAT complex-- there's no reason a high-schooler couldn't understand the particle-in-a-box problem, for example). But, to maybe help make this more accessible, keep in mind that this quantization isn't just a quantum effect. Take a rope, nail the two ends down, and solve equations for what it can do; you'll see that it follows the same quantized pattern as quantum-mechanical systems. It's that end-nailing, and its imposing of what are called \"boundary conditions,\" that gives you discrete energy levels, not anything specific to quantum mechanics.",

I'm not aware of any reliable estimates for wind strength during the time of Pangaea. There are scientists who run atmospheric circulation models for alternative continental configurations such as Pangaea but I doubt we could say with much certainty that the winds at that time were either significantly stronger or weaker.  That leaves the issue of fetch. In general, the greater the distance the wind blows over, the bigger the waves but that only holds up to a certain point - about 1000 km. Beyond that the waves are fully developed and additional fetch doesn't lead to bigger waves. The Pacific is about 10,000 km wide so it already exceeds this critical limit.

If you're wondering why you mix ice and salt when using things like an ice cream churn, it's because having 32 degree Fahrenheit (or less) water helps by creating more contact area with the ice cream tub.

This causes water to continuously come out of your pores, which is why you'd usually have to towel yourself a couple times after showering. Once the moisture is expended from your opened pores and they begin to close, your skin overall becomes very dry.  Returning to your question: your socks stick to your feet because your feet are not fully dried yet. The fabric absorbs the remaining water from your pores as you tightly wrap it around your foot and ankle, causing more friction between it and your skin. This ultimately damages your feet soles, and commonly causes a condition called eczema (dry, breaking skin).  To avoid this, you should properly dry your feet, and then remoisturize them with a good lotion before putting on socks.  Hope this was informative :) I tried to not use big worded terminology.",

If they could they would rest until it healed (that is if the infection didn't kill them), they probably would have the bone set incorrectly or poorly leading to a limp or other problems. They would then need the help of their tribe to get them through life. If life got too hard, and the tribe couldn't help them they would most likely die. There is nothing special about our modern human healing ability, they have found ancient skulls where people have done brain surgery and the patient likely survived. Humans heal pretty well if they can avoid getting infections, and even in poor circumstances humans can survive an awful lot of punishment. Short answer: they would heal if they could, die if they couldn't.",

Because it is a conductor moving through a magnetic field, it distorts that field. This distortion of the magnetic field creates an electrical signal that the guitar then transmits to the amplifier. The amplifier then uses that electrical signal to open and close a transistor/vacuum tube pathway, similar to a dimmer knob on lighting. That transistor/vacuum tube is attenuating a higher power electrical line in sync with that electrical signal from the pickups. The result is an electrical signal that matches the vibration of the strings, amplified sufficiently to drive a speaker cone.",

In regular people, the brain chemistry stops that from happening, but it happens more easily in people with epilepsy. When you watch something flashing over and over again, it causes your vision brain cells to fire in sync, but this shouldn't spread to the *entire* brain.

Some of the radiation that hits the control rod might get absorbed, but the plutonium is not less radioactive. Nor can diffuse of radioactive material be easily reversed. It's not like the rod seeks out and traps the radioactive material. It would be pointless as putting a rod of something chemically neutral in a vat of toxic waste. You still have a vat of toxic waste there. Using explosives weapons technology on nuclear waste would, of course, just disperse the radioactive material and make the problem worse.",

        "response": "You are confusing honing with stropping.  When you sharpen a straight razor you DO push blade first. You only lead with the spine of the razor when STROPPING. Honing (AKA Sharpening) is essentially grinding the metal down to the shape of a blade. This is done on a wet stone (AKA honing stone), blade first STROPPING (what you see done to a straight razor on a leather strap) is not done to \"sharpen\" the blade in the sense that it's reshaping the metal. Stropping sets the \"fin\" on the blade. Metal has many layers, so the heat and abuse a razor gets from the act of shaving disrupts the fine microscopic edge of the metal. With tiny metal flakes going every which-a-way (think bed head) after stropping the tiny metal layers are all lined up and organized (think mohawk) When you hone a razor, you do indeed go blade first. It's only when stropping that you lead with the spine. Source: Been shaving with a straight razor for a while and owned knives for even longer. Also /r/wicked_edge",

They're not all that common in their raw form because they react with things, so they're normally in compounds, like water. You can get hold of pure hydrogen and pure oxygen quite easily though - the easiest way to do it is to use electrolysis to split water. Water is extremely common compared to almost anything else. It takes a lot of energy to split water into hydrogen and oxygen, and when you combine them back again to form water, you get a lot of energy out. You can power a rocket with it. None of this is more practical than just piping water to somewhere that needs it.

You also need to consider that guitar amps just aren't big enough to give you good sound in a large club or stadium.

I can bring a good smartphone to work, then swap the card into an old feature phone when I'm going to be in a bad neighborhood or if I'm doing yard work or other physical work where I might damage my phone. A few years ago, I ended up utterly destroying my phone in a strange city in the middle of the night. Despite the extensive damage, the SIM card was okay.

Shampoos for \"thin\" hair or that are \"for volume\" will contain less of that silicone product and therefore less product will remain on the hair after washing, theoretically making the hair less weighed down and more voluminous.  Shampoos for \"color treated\" hair supposedly contain gentler surfactants to clean the hair and therefore the shampoo should take off less of your color when you wash with it, Amounts and specific ingredients vary by brand.

The idea is that if you set an initial value for something, the equations of motion are such that that something does not change its value -- but different initial conditions would have produced a different value. The speed of light is a constant of nature. It has the same value no matter who does the observing, no matter the situation.

If the wing was symmetrical (as it is with a lot of fighters) or curved on the bottom (as it would be when you are upside down), you lose some of the lift, but you can more than make up for it with angle of attack.

This is extremely useful not only for approximations and numerical estimates. In addition, the same technique applied to an infinitely differentiable function produces an infinite series which equals this function on a given interval. Again this can be much easier to work with than the original function. As an example, an area in combinatorics called generating functions has to do with building functions whose taylor series have a given sequence as coefficients.

This makes about as much sense as comparing car engines based on how much gas they use, rather than how much horsepower they have. Lumens, however, are an actual measurement of how much light a bulb emits. It doesn't matter if you're a wasteful fluorescent bulb or a super-efficient LED - rating the bulb in lumens gives you the same result. The problem is that saying \"40W equivalent\" is a meaningless term and has no basis in reality - it doesn't measure the power consumption *OR* the actual light output.

Once the water is gone, the cellulose molecules are bonded together strongly enough for what we use it for. There are no glues.

However when the cup is used to scoop out the denser gas and the gas is poured into the boat, the denser gas displaces the air and causes the density of the boat to increase thus causing it to sink. With most gases like this I believe you can inhale it and it will lower the pitch of your voice, acting the opposite of helium.

        "response": "Neutron stars are made up of more than just neutrons. Neutronium is only stable under intense pressures, near the surface of the star the pressure diminishes due to the reduced amount of overlying material. Consequently, neutron stars have a \"crust\" of material of different composition. The deepest parts of the crust contains electrons mixed with neutrons and nuclei, the outer part of the crust is entirely atomic nuclei and electrons (electron degenerate plasma similar to white dwarf star material). The mantle is made up of a [nuclear pasta](_URL_0_) where superfluid neutronium mixes with nuclei and electrons in various shapes depending on density. Even in the core there are protons, electrons, and muons. All of these things aside can contribute strongly to magnetic field production. The core of the neutron star is a superfluid which can carry charged electrons and particles in currents, setting up the potential for very strong magnetic dynamos.",

        "response": "There are different ways, especially for pi. I'll focus on ones that are easy to understand, which may not be the most efficient. Because the tangent of pi/4 radians (45 degrees) is 1, the inverse tangent of 1 is pi/4, and by approximating the inverse tangent function as a polynomial series, we can calculate it as: pi=4 x (1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + 1/9 - 1/11...) This is Leibnitz' formula (although it was known earlier in India), and is really slow (it takes hundreds of terms to get a few digits). e is the limit of an exponentially growing process as the rate gets smaller and smaller. That means we can calculate e as the limit of (1+1/n)^n as n goes to infinity. (1+1/1000)^1000 =2.717, for example. Another formula for e is the sum of reciprocal factorials: e=2 + 1/2 + 1/6 + 1/24 + 1/120 + 1/720... where each denominator is 1x2, 1x2x3, 1x2x3x4 etc. These formulae involving sums will make sense if you've taken a class on calculus.",

        "response": "Your playstation controller is using radio waves (specifically microwaves in the 2.4ghz band) which are expanding outward, more or less in a sphere, and are capable of penetrating some solid objects. Your TV remote is likely using infrared light which is invisible to the human eye. It will generally travel only forward from the remote, and will be blocked by most solid things (including the remote itself, which is why it generally goes one direction). If you can't see through it, your remote probably can't either.",

        "response": "1) They didn't \"march into pagan territory to attack Dobrzyn land\". Dobrzyn land was the territory they received from Konrad of Mazovia, and it was Polish rather than pagan Prussian (similarly the Teutonic Order would later receive the Chelmno Land). 2) The 35 you're talking about were knight-brothers. There would be other members, servants etc. so their actual fighting strength was higher.",

        "response": "Caesar is an enormously complicated figure who has had as much written on him as anyone not directly responsible for starting a religious movement. He is also such a complex personality that everyone reading of him comes away with a different impression.  Side note: There is a really interesting book called *Caesar: A Life in Western Culture* by Maria Wyke that is a sort of \"biography of biographies\", taking individual episodes of Caesar's life and showing their reception in different periods of history. Definitely worth reading. Anyway, my point is that you will really need to go back to the sources. Granted, digging through Cicero's letters, reading the *Pharsalia* and parsing through the commentaries is a bit much for a ten minute presentation, but I definitely think it is worth it to read Plutarch and Suetonius--or at least Suetonius. Neither of these are particularly long and they are both a lot of fun, so it is definitely doable.",

        "response": "[This column](_URL_0_) has an in-depth answer, focusing specifically on the absence of the color green. But as it turns out, mammals are only capable of generating brown-black pigment (the melanin that gives skin its tan) and reddish-yellow. These are the dyes which, in various combinations or absences, are responsible for the limited mammalian color palette.    It turns out, amazingly enough, that other terrestrial vertebrates can't create blue or green pigments either! The array of [cool colors](_URL_1_) we see in birds, amphibians, and the like (as well as many brilliantly-colored insects like tropical butterflies) are actually caused by microscopic structures in their feathers or skin. These structures refract the light that bounces off of them, like a prism or a CD, causing us to perceive them as a particular color.",
