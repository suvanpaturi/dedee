Obviously it was a very, very big event, hugely attended by the peasantry. I'm sure one of our Roman historians could also elaborate for you on Roman military Triumphs, which (to my understanding) were celebratory parades in honor of military campaigns.",

        "response": "Well, no one has answered yet... So I'll try to explain it: To put it simply. An MSR uses salt instead of water to transfer thermal energy. However, instead of having fuel rods like in traditional nuclear reactors, the uranium fuel is mixed in with the salt. This creates an inherently stable reactor, as when the heat increases, the salt expands and pushes into cooling tubes. Even if the reactor gets too hot, it cannot go into meltdown, since the materials are already molten. Edit: Water is still used to generate steam to run turbines, it's just that salt is used to directly extract the heat energy from the uranium fuel. Hopefully someone else who knows more about MSR's will find this post. But this is the basics of what I know about them.",

There is some controversy over the solvent propylene glycol that they use to make nicotine vape liquid , but it seems as long as you keep the temperature down you are OK. And actually one can also use vegetable glycerine as a carrier which is probably more benign. But in any case with vaping there is no tar.",

Because there is no more outward pressure resulting from the energy that the fusion usually creates, the star starts to shrink, thus heating up. Once it heats up enough, it reaches the temperature to burn Helium. This process actually repeats a couple of times, causing fusion of increasingly heavy elements. The final result is usually that the star becomes layered: There are different fusion processes going on in different layers in the star. The outer regions are still burning the leftover hydrogen, followed by Helium etc..",

Exposure was a common practice not only for Spartans in the movie 300, but most ancient and many primitive societies. It's very likely that steppe nomads would have engaged in similar practices if children appeared physically disabled or deformed, as they did not have the resources to support extra people that, at least in their view, could not contribute like a \"normal\" man or woman.  That said, children that were exposed could also be adopted by another couple looking for a child. This happened in both Greece and Rome. Perhaps it's also possible that a sturdy looking child, even if it had an unusual facial appearance, would be expected to grow up into a physically strong person and somebody might keep him? For a female however, I think that would be almost impossible as they would struggle to attract a mate in later life.  Overall, I'd say they were generally exposed.",

The other factor is that water behaves very differently than air. Water resists being pushed out of the way, and the harder you push, the harder it pushes back. The fancy term is compressibility. It's because of this that a fall from a great height into water tends to be like hitting concrete.  So, back to the boat. As you spin the propeller faster and faster, it gets harder and harder to turn. Also, the drag of the water against the hull increases, requiring more effort. So, a boat in water is like a car that is going up a very steep hill. It needs to gear down to maintain speed or accelerate. With a boat, it works out that most of the time you only need one or two gears.",

As for why companies do this, it's great advertising. Even if the person takes advantage a little, the actual cost per cone is pretty cheap, and it would take years for the cost of him eating thousands upon thousands of ice creams to equal a single commercial spot. So, for the cost of two commercials (the one advertising the contest, plus the cost of the ice creams), they get thousands or millions of active participants in a contest, including names, addresses, phone numbers, etc., that they know, for sure, are interested in McDonald's.",

The reason your Wi-Fi router's signal strength is limited is that if everyone broadcast really strong signals on the same frequency (and Wi-Fi is only allowed to be on a limited range of frequencies), they'd all interfere with each other and no one's Wi-Fi would work. Think of it like 100 people trying to shout in the same room at the same time, versus everyone having a quiet conversation with the person next to them.

A meter means a pattern of the number of syllables per line in a verse, with the stressed syllables alternating in a predictable way. Probably the most recognizable meter is what Shakespeare used, iambic pentameter. Penta means five, iambic means it starts with an unstressed syllable and then every alternating one is stressed: to BE or NOT to BE, that IS the QUEStion __ 1 ___ 2 ____ 3 _____ 4 ____ 5 _____ This creates a pattern of sound, and it is really easy for us to remember a pattern of sound rather than a pattern of text. If you look at the text of old Norse sagas, like Beowulf, they have a pattern where each line is two halves, and the halves rhyme, and they have a stressed-syllable meter as well.

        "response": "During the French Revolution of early 19th century the society heavily liberalized, with prostitution being legal , theatres promoting works of romanticism; Paris came to establish a standard for fashion , perfume, femininity, class and more.  This created the courtesan(or Lorette), the ideal of an educated, classy, seductive and fashionable lady who is very high maintenance; an equivalent of an expensive escort of today. Those courtesans promoted romantic love.  Through a combination of sexual, romantic and the artistic factors, these traditions survived till today to some extent, creating the image and being the tourist sales pitch.",

And neither should you rev your engine too high, going in to the red of the meter. And no it's not bad to roll down, again as long as the rpm doesn't go in to the red, just shift up to a higher gear if you need to. Engine breaking is actually good for your fuel consumption. As modern cars will complete stop the fuel to the engine if the car is rolling in gear. So if you plan your driving and use your brake as little as possible it will save fuel.",

Considering the fact that Sherman managed that much destruction it's actually impressive how few civilians died, although they lost their homes and property (part of which if I recall correctly was due to some Georgian leaders not ordering evacuations) Sherman's march was remarkably disciplined and resulted in very few casualties considering the scale of the many other battles in the Civil War.",

The illicitly manufactured \"bathtub gins\" were pretty freaking terrible. Mixing it with other things such as a strong-tasting vermouth made it much more palatable, hence the martini. After prohibition, the manufacture and importation of gin became legal again, the quality improved dramatically and it wasn't necessary to drown your foul-tasting gin with a strong vermouth.

All the new \"ground\" comes from resources that they carry into the new city or waste generated from living in the city. Other ruins that do not get buried like the Akropolis or Pantheon often have significant cultural value and remain standing for long periods of time without being demolished and burried.",

Your brain can predict (to some extent) what's going to happen next in the music, so it's anticipating the dopamine shot before it actually gets it, and it's that moment between the anticipation and the reward that gives us goosebumps.  Two, the amydala (what controls our emotions) reacts uniquely to music, acting as if it has 'real' triggers. However, your brain knows that this isn't 'real', so is constantly shutting that down before it becomes a true fight-or-flight reaction, so we get the hairs-on-end physical reaction without the adrenaline.",

        "response": "Basically, when something looks human (be it a doll, a mannequin, a video game character, a drawing, whatever), there's different degrees to which we \"believe\" it. Something that's not very realistic (say, a Raggedy Ann doll) isn't very believable. As you increase the amount of detail or realism, the believability also increases- up to a certain point, at least. At a certain point, if something is very real looking but not COMPLETELY real looking, it is really, really upsetting to our subconscious. It sends off a signal in our brain that says \"Not human! Fake! Don't trust it!\". Only after this point, if it gets considerably more realistic, do we start feeling okay again. This is why mannequins are sometimes creepy. Some kinds of CGI, too, like Jeff Bridges' digital version (CLU) in Tron: Legacy. Ironically, some less realistic CGI (say, The Incredibles for example) is actually a lot less creepy because our mind just sees it as a symbol of a human, rather than a \"fake\" human.",

But a single atom still gives off a characteristic set of colors when excited (its line spectrum). This is the action at work behind the colors given off by gas discharge lamps such as Neon signs. In a gas, the atoms are so spread out that they are effectively free and independent. Therefore, an atom does have a color in a gas-discharge sense.

That way of adding velocities, as it turns out, is only valid when things are very slow compared to light. Makes sense, because light clearly doesn't work that way - if I add the speed of light to any other speed, I should just get the speed of light back. That's what the [relativistic velocity addition formula](_URL_0_) does. Given two velocities, this formula tells you how they're added. It has two nice properties.

Increasing the thrust won't help because as you approach light speed, the mass approaches infinity. From inside the spaceship you wouldn't notice this mass increase, however. The 1 million km markers would appear to keep coming faster and faster, and eventually they'd fly by often enough that you could seemingly clock yourself as superluminal, however at the same time the markers would appear to be closer to each other -- from your frame of reference they'd be less than 1 million km apart, meaning you're not superluminal after all.

If that's all it was, then you'd say \"of course a planet, a solid spherical object, has more order than a big cloud of gas, so it must have less entropy\". But entropy is better described as an inverse measure of how far something is from energy equilibrium, or how much work a system can do. With most terrestrial systems, disorder/order works well, but on a large scale where gravity comes into play, that defintition breaks down. We talk of objects/systems that have potential energy as ones that are high up in a gravitational field and can fall, thereby performing work. Core principle of hydroelectric dams. Therefore, a giant spread-out cloud of gas has a lot of potential energy - it will eventually collapse under gravity and form a star/planet, radiating heat out as it does so. A planet is in a much lower 'energy-state' than the gas, and so has a much higher entropy.",

Then some people in the publishing company (news paper or TV or internet) went from \"If we get rid of the content checkers who don't generate any contents anyway, we can save ourselves money on that.\" and the content checking was then done by people who were supposed to do editorial checks. And then the editorial checks got cut down because the stories coming from the journalists were good enough.

In addition, if you think of the atmosphere as a series of layers, the layers closer to the center have less surface area than those further out, so 120m decrease in water level night only result in a 20m decrease in atmospheric level, such that the change would probably not be remarkably noticeable",

My understanding is that cracks propagate at the speed of sound in the material (someone correct me if I'm wrong here, materials science isn't my specialty). For glass that's about 5000 m/s. There isn't any scale shown in the image, but guessing the ball is about 1 cm, then it would take about 1e-6 s, or 1 millionth of a second for the crack to spread from the point of impact to the size of the ball.

So in this sense they use ionic/hydrogen/VdW interactions to accomplish this. Also, in blood or out of the cell, viruses depend on random movement to help it encounter the cells it needs to infect.

This stuff requires A LOT of hard work, because each word needs to have a certain tone and dialect registered, which is usually why assistants don't work in offline mode, and require a network so the assistant can check with a database or API (Application Programming Interface) to see what it is that is said and what it should do.

Once a miner solves the problem, they announce the answer, update the ledger file with new transactions, and award their own account some bitcoins.

For any given location there simply may not be enough demand for more than one company to service that area. The fixed costs are so high, that adding a second competitor would cause both to lose money at the current pricing, which would mean it would be a disservice to the customer to artificially add a second competitor (because prices would actually go up since you are now effectively paying for redundant infrastructure).",

So to be consistent with other two-variable functions, the expression \"3+4\" should really be written \"+(3,4)\", where the symbol \"+\" is a placeholder for the two-variable function which sums its two arguments. Longer expressions get more unwieldy. For example, the expression \"+(3,\\*(4,5))\" is much more cumbersome than \"3+4\\*5\". So our convention is to write such operators differently, but then we also need a convention for the order in which different operations are performed.",

If you don't have knowledge of Roman numerals, please see itaremeelar's post first. In western music, chords are functional. Basically, there are three functions: tonic, predominant, and dominant. Tonic is I, though sometimes vi or iii; predominant can be vi, IV, or ii (in ascending order of affinity to dominant); and dominant is V or vii. Dominant should always lead to tonic; predominant can lead to another predominant, dominant, or tonic; tonic can be used in most places. In addition to function, chord progressions are governed by \"voice leading.\" Each of the pitches in the chord are treated as voices, and there are ways of moving the voices which are forbidden in textbook theory, such as moving two voices in parallel motion at perfect fifths.",

Simply being a cannibal doesn't mean you're going to get kuru (for example, the men of the cannibal tribes famous for kuru didn't often get the disease, because they ate the muscles while the women ate the brains). So eating lab-grown human meat won't give you kuru simply because it's human meat; it would have to have prions in it. On the other hand, it is possible that they develop a flawed procedure for growing lab-grown meat, that as the proteins grow some of them misfold into prions. That would mean a risk of a prion disease like kuru. But I would hope that such a flaw would be identified and fixed before the procedure gets FDA approval.",

In modern Germany they are like any other social democratic party, back then they were mostly democratic socialists. Their previous name (until 1890) reflects that - social democratic workers party of Germany. Ulbricht was part of the left wing in the party though. That's the party wing that split off after the war, first forming the USPD and then the KPD (communist party of Germany). He joined the KPD in the early twenties.
