As a child being told that something is scary (or seeing that other people are bothered by something) can be enough to cause us to develop the same fears.  Another theory, many phobias have a trigger that helped create them. Basically, something unpleasant happened to us as a child and we associate it with spiders causing a fear/dislike. This might be something as insignificant as walking into a spider web and disliking it. Finally, the idea of something small that could be anywhere and could deliver a poisonous bite is quite scary on its own.",

This is generally heated via gravitational shockwaves, as the gas falls into the massive gravitational potential of the cluster.  Other galaxies, with very active central black holes, can also dump energy into the IGM (which heats it up).  (EDIT... some people are taking issue with 'gravitation shock waves'.

If the feather is one of several needed for flight (e.g. the wing and tail feathers) a wild bird will be at a serious disadvantage. Captive birds will need to have it repaired and even then it will be weak until a new one grows in to replace it. Young birds will molt or shed their feathers periodically as they grow.

Instead of holding the number as-is, it holds two numbers - the mantissa (m) and the exponent (e) - which represent the number m\\*2^(e) (and one extra bit is used for the plus/minus sign). The number 2^64 is can then be represented using m=1 and e=64. It is also possible to represent large numbers in software with an array of numbers. Just like we can represent number of any size using a series of digits, you can for example represent 64 bits with two 32-bit numbers - the 1st number represents the higher order bits and the 2nd number represents the lower order bits. This makes the arithmetic a bit complicated of course - when you add two numbers, first you add the lower order bits, figure out what the carry would be, and then add the higher order bits along with the carry. You can use the same method to represent number of any size (96 bits are three 32-bit numbers, and so on).",

The chip on the other hand also holds this dstadata, but it is a bit trickier. It doesn't actually give this data away when scanned. The chip uses things like the time and date, card number, encryption keys, ect to make a unique number for that specific transaction, which is then sent to the bank, decrypted, then the transaction is confirmed. The most important thing is that each transaction may only have one possible number attached to it. This number is absolutely useless if you want to make future transactions using that card, while a stripe gives away all the data needed to make a transaction.

In English, of course, we also have the c-word, which comes from the word cunny, which sounds like coney, which is what English speakers used to call a rabbit. (In Spanish, conejo means rabbit but also is slang for vulva.) It\u2019s not a coincidence that the words coney and cunny are so similar; both probably go back to the Latin for hole or tunnel. English speakers got tired of all the cunning puns, so we started calling them rabbits instead, and changed the first letter of coney to make the kid-friendly word bunny.

The pipes aren't directional, so if you allowed water to flow in any way you want, you could get some unintended consequences, such as motors rolling backward, etc. Diodes are one-way pipes, so any water flowing through in the wrong way just gets stopped.

The expansion of the universe happens outside of gravity wells, where objects are too far away to fall toward each other. Interactions between galaxies are a fuzzy thing, with tidal forces being quite important due to the large scale of galaxies. If you had two galaxies in a situation like the one you describe, they would exert tidal forces on each other, stretching each other and moving closer. We can measure radial velocity-- the speed at which a galaxy is moving toward or away from us-- with a high degree of accuracy. Measuring distance is much more fraught with error, although we can often get a good distance measurement to within a few percent for galaxies in the local neighborhood.

These oils contains higher levels of coffee flavor and aroma that continue to develop as it brews.

Looking at the parts of the spectrum that is left behind, it wouldn't be hard to imagine pink lemonade transmitting precisely those colors while absorbing the same colors Baja Blast transmits.

Some strains of TB are also resistant to both first- and second-line antibiotics, which makes you effectively *screwed* if you live in a country where you can't receive extensive Chemotherapy.

        "response": "There are a few ways of doing it, but the super simple version works like so: You want to take over the management of a company, or outright buy the whole operation. The company does not want you to do this. In most corporations, the shareholders vote for the members of the board of directors, and the board votes for the officers (president, CEO, etc.). If you want to take over control of the company, you buy up as much of the stock in the corporation as you can to create a large voting block. Sometimes you will need allies to do this too, buying their own stock to help you have enough of a vote. Once you get enough of a vote, you can vote to replace members of the board of directors with people that support your takeover. Then they can select friendly officers. Once you have enough traction inside the company, you make an offer to purchase all of the stock of the company, and your inside \"friendlies\" should have enough of a voice inside the company to approve the sale.",

        "response": "So basically it runs through a list of ranked elements. You usually want the higher ranks first in the list, so if it sees an element ranked lower then the next one down, it swaps them. It goes through the list in one direction, then once it reaches the end it goes back through the list in the other direction. It does this to avoid what are called \"turtles\", which is when an element in the beginning of the list has low rank. If the algorithm only went in one direction, the turtle would only trade places once for every iteration. Going backwards swaps the turtle every time it sees it until it is in its correct spot (somewhere in the bottom of the list). It's worth noting that, although it's a little faster than a bubble sort (which only goes in one direction) it is still pretty slow and not really used. There are far faster and more robust sorting algorithms out there. Cocktail shaker and bubble sort are mostly to teach people about sorting algorithms.",

Scientists are able to design these proteins to cut at the end and the beginning of a particular gene, effectively removing the gene from the DNA. When the cell replicates it copies the DNA that is now missing the removed gene, ensuring that all future cells replicated from the original one are also missing that same gene. For example, let\u2019s say there is an embryo with 8 cells. If these eight cells are subjected to the same CRISPR treatment they will all have the same gene removed. As these cells divide and replicate all future cells will be missing the removed gene. This not only ensures that the organism is missing those genes, it also ensure that all progeny of that organism also are missing that gene.

Use the expression F = -GmM/r^2 for the force on your falling object, which gives you a = -GM/r^2 for its acceleration (F is force, G is the gravitational constant, m is mass of falling object, M is mass of massive object that it is falling towards, r is distance between centers of objects, a is acceleration). Then you can integrate twice to get an expression that features the radius as a function of time and the time elapsed. Given the initial and final radius you can easily calculate the time elapsed, but the other way round (calculate the time elapsed when you have the initial and final radius) is more complex so you may have to do that numerically.

Since only a few roaches in any given group will be molting at a given time, a single burst of radiation would only affect the molting roaches and most would walk away unscathed. However, all roaches will have to molt at some point (or die of old age if they're done growing) and lingering radiation would kill them when that happened. It would take a little while longer for the radiation from a nuclear blast to kill the roaches, but it would get the job done. This is also true for most insects, not just roaches.

This means that there\u2019s an uncertainty (a \u201cwidth\u201d) in the masses of the pions, inversely proportional to their mean lifetime. Just considering QCD, the pions are indeed eigenstates of the Hamiltonian, so they\u2019d have infinitely precise masses, and they wouldn\u2019t decay if QCD were the only physics in the universe. However the mass of a bound hadron has little to do with the bare masses of the valence quarks that make it up. For example, the vast majority of the mass of a proton or neutron could not be explained if you assume that the mass of a nucleon is the sum of the bare masses of the three valence quarks. The same is true of mesons, the bare quark masses don\u2019t necessarily mean anything when it comes to the mass of the entire meson.",

However, sometimes when such a person first starts taking an anti-depressant the fog begins to lift, just a little bit. So, the feelings of worthlessness and suicidal ideations are still there, but the drugs lift them just enough to where they can motivate themselves to go out and perform the suicidal act they could only fantasize about before. edit: Yes, this is speculation and has not been proven, though it is a popular belief among many mental health professionals.

When it is broken however it tends to break in very ''unsmooth'' ways. Therefore when hitting the surface the light gets it direction changed differently depending on the exact angle at the spot where that individual wave hits it. This is due to the fact that the process of [refraction](_URL_0_) is angular dependent.

As a result, on a warm night, much of your body's heat might be in your feet, where it can radiate away better to try to cool you down.

The top knot is only supposed to open when you're swallowing and only just enough to let the food get into your stomach. When you have reflux, it's because your top knot malfunctioned and accidentally let acid up and out, instead of keeping it inside the stomach with the food. Stuff is only supposed to go out the bottom knot.  Edit: There are a couple of reasons your top knot might malfunction. Most commonly it's because it could become \"lazy\" and dilly dally before closing after you swallow. if the knot doesn't close when the food goes in, the food will displace some acid and some will get pushed up into the esophagus.

You're able to plot how you'd go about it. You start to prepare yourself to actually do it. You prepare for the action, but are inhibited by a wide variety of factors, including knowledge that flipping your chair for no reason would be a very silly thing to do. In very simple terms, alcohol doesn't interfere without ability to think about doing things nearly as much as it interferes with the ability of thoughts to inhibit the actions you are considering. One of the more pleasant effects of this is that it makes all of the worries you have when you are talking to others less likely to stop you from following through with talking to others.",

Mammals also seem to learn which other animals are predators. But most animals will also learn to generalize. So if (as a hypothetical) a squirrel has learned that a hawk is a predator, but a sparrow is not, he might also think that sea gull is a predator because of its size; and minnows will generalize trout, but then not extend that to pike. And robins that have never encountered a mammal will learn after one encounter that a stoat is a predator and will react accordingly the next time they encounter a stoat.

After decades of talking and running, your eyes are really good at compensating for the anticipated movement and keeping steady. Both your eye muscles and your leg muscles are being controlled by your brain, and so it can coordinate the movement of the two using knowledge of what is expected to happen to your body when you take the next step.  Second, what you see is not what your eyes are seeing. Your eyes send raw data to he brain, and the brain makes a picture using the data. You see that picture. Since processing data is boring, and brains are lazy, it usually just assumes parts of the image are what is expected to be there unless something stands out.

The price for a ton of CO2 is currently at [$12.79](_URL_0_); however, the gas issuing from LA is methane, so that would have to be converted in CO2 equivalents. The EPA says that a ton of CH4 is equivalent to 22.7 tons of CO2. And the LA methane leak is in the order of 1300 tons per day. Thus: 1300 tons x 22.7 x $12.79 = about $377 432 in carbon rights per day should be the going rate. Furthermore, the leaks have apparently been going for nigh on 2 months, so that would be a ballpark figure of around $22 645 974, without going into the actual intricacies of the system which would bring the total down a bit.",

Much of that surface deformation is indeed brittle. Which is why volcanic edifices are typically pretty unstable; flank collapses and debris flows are not uncommon - the only reason they're not always obvious is that volcanoes grow at such a (geologically) rapid rate that these scars get healed over by new material quite quickly.

So on Earth, the maximum height for a mountain is roughly 10 - 15 km. If this mountain is already on a high plain, then the actual elevation is the height of the mountain plus the elevation of the plain, but high plains are governed by the same physics. There's also some fuzziness on the maximum height of an atmosphere. On Earth, this is about 100 km, but in reality, the atmosphere is a continuum of particles that decrease in density as you go higher. But it should be obvious that on Earth, the atmosphere is about an order of magnitude higher than the tallest mountains. On a planet with very little atmosphere, it would be possible to build a mountain higher than the atmosphere.

So far, apart from Russia, only Afghanistan, Nicaragua, Syria and Venezuela have recognised the legitimacy of Russian rule over Crimea.

        "response": "Most bacteria don't cause us to vomit. The ones that do, usually produce exotoxins that irritate the lining of the stomach. Interestingly, the bad bacteria that cause vomiting usually have pre\\-formed their exotoxin \\(like by sitting around in old potato salad\\) before you eat them. The toxin then irritates the stomach and signals to the brain \\(area postrema\\) to induce vomiting. In this case, it is usually not necessary to prescribe antibiotics to cure this stomach bug because you're not actually infected; the toxin is just an irritant. When you ingest bad bacteria that multiply inside your gut they usually cause diarrhea instead of vomiting. Again this is caused often by the formation of various toxins, however; there are a few key differences. One, in this case the toxins are lower in the GI tract and so they usually don't cause vomiting. Two, the bad bacteria in these cases have begun to multiply in the gut and are actively producing the toxins. In this situation antibiotics may be warranted.",
