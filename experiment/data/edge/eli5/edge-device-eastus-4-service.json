The US (and the now-defunct USSR) have at times supported certain groups they felt best represented their interests in the region, but *they did not create those groups*. So if the world left it alone it wouldn't suddenly become a modern utopia of peace and understanding, the borders will eventually be redrawn (likely violently) and that will eventually stabilize the region to some degree.",

The laser weapon is so far outside of the visible spectrum that it would just pass through.  Secondly, even if you had a \"mirror\" in the wavelength the laser weapon worked in, the mirror would still have to absorb a lot of energy.

This applies to very large species such as sperm whales, whose skeletons are not made to support their own weight. When floating in the water this is fine, but on land their bodies are so heavy that they crush themselves. 2. Dehydration. This is common for dolphins. A dolphin is not made for being out of the water and loses a lot of water very quickly when exposed to air. If left on a beach for too long, they will dry out and eventually die. 3. Drowning. This might sound strange, but it can happen when high tide comes in. If the whale is on a slope, it's possible the water is high enough to cover the blowhole, but not high enough to submerge the entire whale (allowing it to swim/float). The whale cannot breathe and will eventually suffocate.",

Water can only dissolve so much of the salt before it\u2019s full, and can\u2019t take any more. But, hot water can dissolve a lot more than room temperature water can.  So, they make the solutions in the hand warmers while the water is hot, and then slowly cool them down so that the water is tricked into having more salt dissolved in itself than it normally would be able to at room temperature.  When you snap the metal, it creates a disturbance which makes the water \u201crealize\u201d it was \u201ctricked\u201d, and all the extra salt that the water wouldn\u2019t normally dissolve at room temperature is kicked out of the water into solid form.

Just like a plate of cold food from your fridge would smell much better and stronger once you heat it up. It would depend on your local environment what's directly responsible for the smells of a hot day. There's also a substance called petrichor that can be released by dry soil when it gets rained on that's responsible for that \"rain\" smell. There could easily be another similar process involved to produce a distinctly \"warm\" smell.",

But the forces between **nucleons** do not increase with distance. This is called the \"residual strong force\", or simply \"nuclear force\". The nuclear force is generally attractive at low energies, and very short-ranged (a few femtometers). It's also spin- and isospin-dependent, but that's unimportant for our purposes. The nuclear force is exactly why fusion happens in the first place. But since the nuclear force has such a short range, any two nuclei which you're trying to fuse will have to overcome a repulsive barrier (Coulomb and centrifugal) in order to do so. (The only time there is no barrier to overcome is for a neutron with zero orbital angular momentum.)",

What you have there is a \"ferro rod\" or \"fire starter\" made of [ferrocerium](_URL_0_). The principle is the same - scrape it with a hard piece of steel and the shavings burn - but what happens here is that the shavings come from the stick you're scraping, not the metal that you're scraping it with.

In other words, the atmosphere pushes down on the water, which is then pushed up through the straw because of the pressure difference between the top of the straw and the surface of the water. The longest possible straw then is simply the height of water that can be supported by one atmosphere of pressure. Hydrostatic (gauge) pressure is *p* = \u03f1gh, where \u03f1 = density of water, g = acceleration due to gravity, and h = depth of water.

Those multipoles migrate, then re-coalesce to a dipole oriented at or near the opposite polarity of the previous stable orientation. This will likely take decades to centuries.

For the Schwarzschild black hole, the surface gravity is proportional to,  * k = 1/4M  Where M is the mass. This is surprisingly related to the temperature of the black hole as well.  * T = k/2pi = 1/8piM It is interesting to see that bigger more massive black holes have both a weaker surface gravity and lower temperature. Make no mistake though, the \"weak\" surface gravity at the event horizon of a big black hole still dooms you to never return in the same way a smaller black hole with stronger surface gravity would.

        "response": "A turbocharger is a device which uses exhaust gases in an engine to power a fan (turbine) which pressurizes air and pumps it into the intake of a car. A turbo does not feed exhaust gases back into the car, but rather takes advantage of the otherwise wasted energy of high pressure exhaust gases. At low pressures, a turbo can help an engine 'breathe' and use that otherwise wasted energy to make power more efficiently. But at higher pressures, it increases performance at a cost of efficiency. This is because a precise amount of air and fuel must be delivered into a combustion chamber, or gasoline won't explode properly. More air into the engine means more fuel is needed to maintain that ratio, which amounts to a lot more power but also a lot more fuel. Turbos are prone to breaking, add complexity and cost to an engine design and can potentially wear an engine out faster. If a non-turbo engine (naturally aspirated) can make the target power and efficiency without it, manufacturers often opt for not adding one.",

Let's plug that in. 55 / 7.75 is 7.096 and change, so again, the true answer is somewhere in between. Our next guess is 7.423.

But then, as you brake, the high pressure forces more and more fluid out until you can no longer brake. For example, if I squeeze a closed soda bottle with soda in it, it will resist and feel hard, and I won't be able to crumple the bottle. That's the liquid compressing, like how your brakes work. If I then make a thin slit nest the top of a closed soda bottle, some soda might drip out, but the rest would stay.

        "response": "There are many ways to tell the age of an animal, usually it is done via dentition. However, in the case of Orcas and other marine mammals the only real way is through large photo databanks. Photos of the orcas, especially their dorsal fins can tell you exactly who is who based on the size, shape, colouration, and scars. \"Granny\" the 103 year old Orca was probably placed into a databank long ago, and her features noted. Every once and a while very old orcas are spotted. Now that we have much more comprehensive [photo] databanks we will be able to learn more about the longevity of marine mammals over the coming decades.",

        "response": "Because when an object is introduced to airflow, the air travels on practically all sides of said object. A shape like a sphere is easier to do this with because there are no edges to stop, slow, or block the air from hitting all the surface area. So when you hold an airflow below an object, the center of airflow is the strongest, and gravity is pushing down on the top. Because a ping pong ball is effected by gravity less than something like a bowling ball, a less powerful airflow is needed. Hence why it floats, rather than infinitely rise or fall. It's both going up and down at the same time, keeping it relatively stable. The gravity pulls it down, but the airflow pushes it up and locks it in place due to the airflow moving around the surface area of said object.",

The Lower South was very much a three way race with Douglas, Bell, and Breckenridge all capturing large portions of the vote. Breckenridge in fact won only slightly more than fifty percent of the vote in the seven states that would become the CSA, and he would have lost several states if Douglas's and Bell's votes are counted together (as both stood as Unionist candidates). In the Upper South Breckenridge's position is worse, with Lincoln surprisingly winning a large number of votes in a few border states, and overall Unionist candidates performing better. More to your original question, Breckenridge like most in the Upper South advocated for compromise after the initial seven states left the Union and didn't join the CSA until well after Jefferson Davis was elected president.",

That is, even though there was Lamarck, who proposed that species could change in appearance somewhat, he did not say that one species could change so much it became a different species, nor that one species might have several populations branch off and become other species.  However, the similarities between humans and apes and monkeys were noticed earlier. This is best indicated by Carl Linnaeus, creator of the binomial nomenclature system which we use (with a few adjustments) today to refer to different species. He placed humans and apes together in the same category. Bonus fact: Charles Darwin's grandfather, Erasmus Darwin, translated Linnaeus's works into English.",

That doesn't mean that photons are still not there, from other light sources - but simply not from the one that was blocked. Another possibility to think of is the object emitting the light is no longer there. In that case you will still receive photons up to the point where the object stopped creating them (delayed, of course, by the distance to the object). So... if a star 1 million light years away burns out today, you will still see photons for 1 million years - even though the star no longer exists.",

The other involved Australia agreeing to take in Central American refugees from camps in Costa Rica and settle them in Australia.

Reality comes along and shows that you might be wrong. You have two options, according to conventional information processing: accommodation or assimilation, which basically mean that you can either change your world view to incorporate the new idea... Or you can change the idea to fit into your world view. Assimilation and accommodation are how we deal with our world view being challenged. It's much easier for most people to assimilate (change the idea) than it is to accommodate (change the world view). This is why people react violently to reality challenging them.

This uses up time, space (more synapses), ATP and all manner of neurotransmitters, which is not cost effective. So the brain picks the useful things and stores them, all the useless crap is not retained. The more a memory is used, the more important it is, so the stronger it gets. The mechanism by which the brain does this is not fully understood yet, but it is easily observable. You have to remember that every system has limitations, and everything is a careful balance between variables.

Easy answer: money. The money ISPs ask for their internet at a certain speed is far above the cost they have to maintain that connection.  Let's say an ISP has 100Mbps available (very low, but it's about the concept).  They could ask 10Elis for 10Mbps, earning 100Elis per month maximum.  Alternatively, they could give 20Mbps for those 10Elis and earn only 50Elis per month maximum.  That's assuming no overselling (other posts explained this already) but the conclusion is the same even if you include overselling: As a customer, you love the idea of getting twice the speed for the same price.

Often times we think of one object simply orbiting another because the object being orbited is so much larger than the object orbiting. But even the Moon orbiting the Earth, the Moon pulls on the Earth some, making it wobble, as the Earth and Moon really orbit the Barycenter between them. However, the center of mass of the Earth/Moon system is actually still \"inside of\" the Earth- it's about 4000 km from the center of the Earth, which has a radius of about 6000 km.  As the objects get closer in size to each other, the approximation that one object simply orbits the other gets worse and worse.

I think kidneys are implanted whole, hopefully in bigger children. These also can hypertrophy (get bigger) as needed. Hearts would be very unusual. Not sure it could work without a similar sized donor. As far as I know (not a paediatric transplant surgeon!) the goal is to delay transplant as long as possible so sizes work better. So in the heart they do a while bunch of weird operations like cutting out bad pieces and sticking vessels in weird spots, as a temporary measure. Past that, I think the odds of getting a super-specialist in here are low, but there will be tons of case reports in the literature. Just google \"paediatric transplant\" with the organ of interest",

A brake can lock the rotor when energy isn't needed. They need to be big because the wind is only so strong. By making them bigger, the wind has more surface area to act on, which means more total force can be made. This force is run into a generator, where more force=more power. Bigger ones actually need less wind to turn. They also get more efficient as you scale up. To put it in perspective, the big ones you see are about 300 ft tall with 100ft blades, and put out about 1.5 million watts. The biggest have a rotor diameter of about 540 feet and put out 8 million watts. A REALLY BIG home turbine will put out 2000 watts with a 10-foot blade diameter.

Since it is proven that Pi is irrational, we know that Pi is not a repeating decimal. Furthermore, I could imagine that the statement, that Pi contains all number combinations at some point can be disproven, since it is possible to have an infinite, non-repeating series of digits with less than ten numbers. So it could be possible that some occurrence of the number 9 is the last in Pi and thus any finite series of numbers repeating Pi up to the last occurrence of 9 and *then* adding an additional 9 would be a series of digits that is not contained in Pi.

I realize that 2 & 3 look similar, but they are very different. The focus depth is how far away from the lens on your scope is the focal point. The depth of field/focus is how far in front and behind the focal point images will stay in focus.  As an example, lets say you have a 50x scope with a focus depth of 50 yards and a depth of field/focus of 20 yards.

Basically, oxygen has a far greater electronegativity than hydrogen (that is, oxygen attracts electrons more strongly than hydrogen). For this reason, electrons in water tend to congregate to the oxygen rather than the two hydrogen, and one side becomes more negative while the other side becomes more positive.  tl;dr - recent studies indicate it's possible, but water is already slightly magnetic so you wouldn't need to do it to get an effect.",

Wind farms likely increase the local surface temperature by a degree or two, since they decrease the surface-level wind speeds, which decreases turbulent heat flux (turbulence which carries heat away from the ground). Note that this does *not* increase the overall temperature of the atmosphere, since this is a heat transport effect and not a direct heating effect. This likely has further implications for local precipitation and evaporation, but I can't find any relevant studies on the exact effects so I won't speculate.

But physicists are continuing to conduct experiments on protons (as well as neutrons and electrons) to be more and more sensitive. See, ferinstance, _URL_0_ for ongoing work on the proton.

When you're stopping in cleats, they've penetrated into the ground, and then are being forced against the bulk of it, requiring deforming and lifting the dirt.

So what happens if you don't have enough oxygen? Well it kinda depends, but the simple reaction goes C3H8 + 2 O2 - > 3 C + 4 H2O So in this reaction we require less than half the oxygen, but instead of producing CO2 gas, we produce 3 atoms of carbon.

The doctor or pharmacist can change the frequency by changing the dose. To reduce the frequency, you can boost the dose, and vice versa. Sometimes, if an individual isn't clearing a drug quickly (kidneys or liver not doing their job correctly), the dose and/or the frequency have to be decreased to avoid poisoning the patient.

If we only allow \"real\" solutions, then we run into a problem where a lot--in fact, almost all--of the equations have fewer than n solutions.
