Simply put: your nerves are surrounded by supporting cells (called glial cells) that will form a kind of protective channel through which the axon (the long \"information highway\" of the nerve cell) extends. If the axon is damaged at some part of its length while the soma (the body of the nerve cell, where the nucleus is) remains alive, the axon can grow back, and it will grow along the path that the glial cells are keeping open for it, until it reaches the end. There are other details (this works only in the peripheral nervous system, which is why the brain and spinal cord don't recover so well, and the PNS glial cells are mostly [Schwann cells](_URL_0_), in case you want to read more about them).

There's other, more complicated ones for more specialized tasks, but these four are easiest to tie, have been around longest, and are the most often used.

(For example, an afternoon playing will likely not be as long-term memorable as a trip to Disney). But if you got swamped with new information that day, not everything is permanently written down and so you forget some stuff like your equation. When you're younger and learning lots, you're pretty good at this conversion process, so many long-term memories exist and can be recalled well into adulthood.

When you remove the turkey from the oven, the outer layers are going to be much hotter than the center, and this conduction and convection is going to continue until the entire mass is close to the same temperature. Therefore, if you wait until the center of the mass is as hot as you want it to be, when you remove the external heat source you will have the center at temperature T and the outside as T+N, where N > 0, and when the meat rests it will equilibriate until the uniform temperature of the meat (TU) is T < TU < T+N.",

The extra energy is released as heat and light. The heat causes the same reaction in remaining complex molecules. This happens until the fuel (complex molecules) is exhausted.

Like blood vessel constriction/dilation, and a change in hormone levels. (And that's also why more women suffer headaches than men.)  Certain patterns of brain activity have been found to trigger blood vessel constrictions, which will reduce the oxygen supplied to the brain. Consequently, the blood vessels dilate and some chemicals that cause inflammation are released. The nerves nearby have pain sensitive endings and these can be triggered by that, activating the pain centres in return.  As for migraines, we are less familiar wih how they work but apparently have something to do with the constriction and dilation of blood vessels too.",

These are medications like paracetamol (acetaminophen), ibuprofen and aspirin.  Unlike stronger pain relievers such as opioids (e.g. morphine), these don't actually work on the brain to reduce pain. They act by reducing pain transmission to the brain at the site of tissue damage. They do this by inhibiting an enzyme called cyclooxygenase, which acts to produce chemicals known as prostaglandins.  One thing prostaglandins do is produce inflammation at sites in the body where tissue has been damaged. The inflammation is what causes the pain. So by reducing prostaglandins you reduce inflammation and hence reduce pain. Another thing prostaglandins do is act on the hypothalamus' thermoregulatory centre, causing a high body temperature.",

Your point two points to precisely why we use the correlation coefficient: It's difficult to make sense of precisely what covariance means because part of the information involved is how disperse each of your two variables are on their own, which isn't really important for considering how they're correlated. Covariance is, of course, part of correlation so even if the only thing we ever wanted to do was measure the correlation between things, we would still need to calculate it.

So under a simplistic model, it will not work harden because you're not operating it in a regime with plastic deformation. however, this disregards 'fatigue^1 ', which is often seen in cyclically loaded materials (even if the cycle stays within the elastic region). On the microstructural level, there are sometimes stress concentrators (e.g. inclusions, microcracks, etc) that can cause local stress to be high enough for plastic deformation. After many cycles, these stresses can cause cracks to grow and ultimately failure. An example of research in this area is the metals used in heart stents (e.g. Nitinal). They have a high strain and need to last a whole lot of cycles (heartbeats), and fatigue is a big issue! I don't know the answer to how long powerlines last, but in general, fatigue failure is an important aspect of material selection and design choice. [1]_URL_0_",

Too many unpaid business loans puts the bank out of business. Too many banks out of business monopolizes capital and reduces credit availability to too-low of a level for the economy to function.

        "response": "Alcohol activates the GABAa receptor leading to a loss of GABArgic neuron function in the brain. GABAa receptors help modulate neuron activity by transporting Cl- ions into the postsynaptic neuron, hyperpolorising it, making it harder for it to pass on a signal. In this way, alcohol is considered a central nervous system depressant. With regards to nausea, the body typically responds to high amounts of intoxication by trying to rid itself of the perceived source of the drug (ie vomiting). In addition to this, motion sickness can be caused by lack of motor control.",

The only way to bypass this would be to somehow manipulate the nuclei of the atoms and change the atoms into something else. We've only come as far as splitting atoms for bombs and destructive means. The \"strong force\" that holds a nucleas together is fundamentally unknown, so we are unable to manipulate an element at this level and cannot stabilize the waste by any means besides allowing it to naturally decay.",

Running the fan at the maximum speed of the motor is more efficient and the fan will last longer since the motor does not have to adjust to the increased power flow as you go from low to high.  There is not a lot of strain on the motor when you turn the fan on, as the current flows without any limitation, and when you turn the power off, the fan stops on it's own with no adjustment of the speed of the motor. When you turn the speed of the fan down, the loss of current slows the fan down. Again, no strain on the motor.",

A gene is a specific sequence of DNA or RNA that can be translated (by the ribosome) into a protein. Genes are stored as DNA sequences. DNA is double stranded and much more stable than RNA. When a cell needs a particular protein, the DNA is partially unwound and an RNA copy pf the gene is made from the DNA strand (called messenger RNA or mRNA). This process is called transcription. The mRNA is used by the ribosome as a template to make the protein (the gene product). This is called translation. mRNA is one class of RNAs. Other RNAs include: rRNA (ribosomal, these are parts of the ribosome), tRNA (transfer RNA are involved in translation), ncRNA (non-coding RNAs that don't code for a protein and are involved in regulating the expression of proteins).",

Polarized light, like all light, will induce magnetic and electric dipoles within the matter it interacts with. These induced dipoles are distortions of the electron clouds around the molecule, and can thus be seen by looking at the absorbance spectra of chiral molecules using polarized light.

Some WWII planes used elliptical wing planforms since it was the most efficient shape at the time, but also more expensive to make. In most cases they settled for a compromise solution where the shape wasn't quite an ellipse but the performance wasn't much worse and the costs were cheaper. These curvy wingtips probably responded to that attempt of making the wings more ellipse-like without making them much more expensive. But under the new conditions brought by jet engines this was no longer that important, having elliptical wings or very curvy tips didn't help much but it added costs.

I also believe social issues take precedence over fiscal issues. Ergo, I vote democrat. Others may use different methods. For example, they may only care at all about one issue. Depending on which side of the issue a party typically sides, that's how you vote. For example: I believe abortion is the murder of babies. Baby murder should be stopped no matter what. The Republican party tries to stop abortions. I vote Republican. The third and final way that I know about is based on family and community. You vote based on how your family votes.

More to the point, the receptors in our eyes discern red, green and blue.) Whereas your eye only really has three types of colour receptors, your nose (and tongue) has hundreds or maybe thousands of different smell (and taste) receptors. This is understandable - light is really just a wave that can take on different wavelengths. Smell is far more complicated - smells are really just certain chemical compounds that can take on many, many different shapes and forms.

Higher octane ratings (and therefore more compressible fuel) are used in high performance engines that need to compress the fuel before igniting it.  There are a couple different ways to measure the octane rating. One method yields the Research Octane Number (RON), which is determined in the lab under pretty ideal conditions. Another rating is the Motor Octane Number (MON) which is determined under less ideal conditions (higher RPM motor, preheated fuel mixture, etc.). The MON is usually about 10 octane less than the RON. In the US gas stations have to advertise the average of the RON and MON. This is called the (R+M)/2 method. In the UK petrol stations can advertise just the RON.

Another hypothesize is that kissing may in fact be instinctual considering animals such as the Bonobo and the Chimpanzee monkey kiss as means of social interaction. Kissing, by humans at least, is believed to be traced from India all the way back as far as 326 BC. The main reason why we kiss is because our lips house a lot of sensitive nerve endings, resulting in a wave of information being sent to the brain during a kiss; aka, it's a pleasurable feeling.

A bottle of juice at rest has a volume of gas on top, a volume of liquid on bottom, and a surface area of interface in the middle, all at equilibrium. When you shake a bottle, you produce more surface area which allows dissolved gas to partition from the liquid into the bulk gas phase. When you stop shaking there is exists a greater amount of gas in the bulk gas phase, which results in a greater pressure. That pressure of gas either escapes when you open the bottle, or is forced back into the liquid to establish the initial equilibrium.",

During inflation space was filled with a constant energy density from a field called the inflaton; a constant energy density induces an exponential expansion of space. Since the volume of a given region expands exponentially, and energy density stays a constant (instead of \"diluting\" like normal matter) then the total energy in the region grows exponentially. When inflation ended, the inflaton collapsed to its ground state and its energy turned into matter and radiation.

Squeezing into tighter clothing does cause certain shapes (i.e. muffin top) to form, but it has no impact on the overall volume.  So if you are carrying weight in your belly it's not like that weight is going to suddenly shift to your thights, it'll still be there but just in a different shape.",

Like genes, languages gradually change over time, and any groups that don't speak to each other frequently change in different ways until they're no longer mutually intelligible. In a sense, every language now could be considered a descendant of the language(s) of the humans at the most recent global population bottleneck.  Incidentally, the same thing is true for other animals with language. Whales, monkeys, birds, etc, have local and regionally different languages taught from adults to children. For all relevant species including humans, the particular languages emerged over deep time in parallel with the genes for language (including sound making, hearing, and cognition). If that process took place in disparate environments, each language would be unique, united only by the similar biological constraints on what kind of sounds can be made and grammars can be understood.",

During electron emission a neutron becomes a proton, emitting an electron (and antineutrino). How is it possible that they can convert back and forth by continuously losing particles?",
        "response": "A proton is made of 2 up quarks and 1 down quark. A neutron is 2 down quarks and 1 up quark. In beta- decay, an up quark converts to a down quark, and emits a W- boson. This boson decays to an electron and an antineutrino. In beta+ decay, a down quark converts to an up quark and emits a W+ boson, which decays to a positron and a neutrino. So at the nucleus level, what you see is a proton change to a neutron and vice-versa. But what is actually happening has to do with quarks flipping back and forth. One other thing to note is that the neutron has more mass than the proton. As a result, a free neutron can beta- decay, but a free proton cannot beta+ decay. The reaction isn't reversible (in that sense). Beta+ decay can only occur in bound nuclear states, where some of the binding energy can go into the mass needed.",

So if you say cut your hand really bad, all the nerves around the cut trigger at once, and then they have to rebuild their excitation level, and then they trigger again, and then they rebuild... The result is waves of pain that correspond to how long it takes your nerves to recharge.  Alternatively if you get something like a bruise or a not bad cut, that bruise will cause your nerves to be excited, but not enough to trigger them. Then something that pushes on your bruise, even lightly (for instance, the pressure of your heartbeat passing under the bruise), will cause the nerves to trigger. Then you get throbs of pain corresponding your heartbeat.

You've taken information that was repeated and reduced it to a single instance plus how many times to repeat it. You can also take a pattern that repeats a lot and designate a symbol to represent it. We do this in English with things like copyright and trademark symbols, road signs, bathroom designations, and acronyms and initialisms. This is why some types of data are more compressible than others. Things like a Word document is going to have a lot of repetition due to the standard formatting operators, but something like an MP3 is almost all unique with very little repetition.

The only thing that matters is the difference in temperature between the fridge and the outside, and how well insulated that barrier is. Assuming, of course, that the fridge door is never opened. There is some small effect when the door is opened a lot. The presence of more solids in the fridge means that less volume of warm air can enter when the door is opened, whose heat must then be pumped out by the compressor.

If I'm on the side of the road, I *also* measure your headlights emitting light at 100% of c. Space and time twist themselves into a pretzel to honor this invariant. So, for example, I measure time in your car to be running slower. You measure distances along the road as being shorter. It's counter-intuitive, but it is what we observe.

Regular oil-based combustibles have a specific energy of just under 50 KJ (Kilojoule) per gram. That's a factor 40 million difference. Of course, that's a very simplistic estimate and a fusion reaction would also need deuterium, but the main conclusion is that the energy density of fusion processes is orders of magnitude larger than that of regular fuels. So the current price of tritium would not be an issue for future fusion reactors, even if the price would increase. But since we can produce tritium from more abundant elements, it is to be expected that the production rate of tritium would go be increased if the demand increases dramatically.

        "response": "There is a wonderful programming language called [processing](_URL_0_) that was developed at MIT specifically for people with zero programming experience to create visual applications.  It comes with it's own editor, and has an excellent tutorial. You can make your own simple interactive applications in 10 lines of code, with no importing libraries or anything ugly.  In addition, it has a mode specifically for android development, and you can export apps directly to a phone connected by usb.  I can't imagine anything easier, and there is a ton of documentation and help videos. It's built on java, so if you get good with it, it's easy to move on to more complicated programming.",

        "response": "Are you referring to the 732 BC conquest by the Assyrians, the 500 BC conquest by the Babylonians, or the Third Jewish/Roman Revolt of 130 AD? The Romans killed and kicked out nearly all Jews. Why do you blame the Palestinians for that? Does this mean I can go back to my ancestral home in Ireland and take the land back from the family that bought it form the English occupiers? Is the statute of limitations 200 years or 2000 years?",
