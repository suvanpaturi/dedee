        "response": "The West is an enormous place so generalizations are difficult to make. That said, the majority of the region was and continues to be largely urban in its settlement. Since most people in the nineteenth century did not have a horse (contrary to the Hollywood-based stereotype), people had to be able to walk to work, shopping, places of worship, places of leisure, etc. This often resulted in tightly-packed houses. There was often room in the back (for an outhouse and also for a place for chickens or growing vegetables, etc., but the idea of a large yard surrounding a house and setting it away from the road is a fairly late ideal for the West.",

[ChemCam](_URL_1_), Curiosity's laser, is designed to target a small amount of rock from a distance and then analyse the resulting flash of light using a telescope. [SAM](_URL_2_) aka the Sample Analysis at Mars sensor suite is actually three instruments, two of which are spectrometers (the third is a gas chromatograph). One is a mass spectrometer, which vaporizes a sample and determines what elements are present by their mass. The other is a tunable laser spectrometer that is used to determine if a number of isotopic elements are present (with more accuracy than ChemCam, as the SAM is designed to test samples that are aboard Curiosity).",

Enzymes are proteins which are long chains of amino acids which fold in a very particular way. If the 3D structure of the enzyme changes in any way, it's function will decrease or stop. The way the enzyme is folded is in part determined by the pH. Change the pH, such as the addition of lemon juice, the rate of browning decreases.",

        "response": "For waves to interfere, i.e. cancel each other out or amplify each other, they have to have a very similar frequency, as in \"almost the same\". Imagine a lake. You throw two small stones in it, 5 meters apart. The small concentrical waves around each stone will interfere with those from the other and build a nice pattern on the lake. If you now take a muuuuuch bigger stone and throw it somewhere in the lake, the resulting waves will be much higher and have a much larger wavelength. They will not interfere with the smaller waves in the sense I explained above, but will simply \"carry\" the smaller waves on top. The interference patterns from the two small stones will still exist on the big wave. Since all electronics are highly regulated, everything that emits data has a distinct frequency and often times a mechanism to switch to another one, if there s a similar device around to avoid interference.

What answers historians give have a lot to do with their own understandings of colonialism and since answers to those questions rely on still contentious theoretical debates there will be a lot of disagreement. There are a range of views amongst historians. On one extreme of that range is the positions that thugee was mostly an invention stemming from anxieties about an unknowable indigenous underworld, on the other end there are people who uncritically accept all British claims. In between there are many people who are interested in analyzing thugee as a real form of banditry that became distorted in the minds of the British. Personally I find the last option most convincing, but my knowledge isn't deep enough to referee that debate fairly.

The ph letters are attributed normally to Greek inspired words, like Philosophie. The ph N\u00e9nuphar stood its ground and still does, even though the major language instances in the French-speaking world nowadays prefer to honor its roots by recommending to write with an f : n\u00e9nufar.

No. A typical SSD's (depending on which controller you prefer) read and write speed are near 500mb/s. A hard drive, at it's fastest, is, maybe 80-100mb/s. A high end computer's latency (aka, the thing that slows it down the most) is it's hard drive. Removing an analog hard drive for a digital hard drive dramatically increases it's speed when a hard drive is paged.  So, if you're a gamer, a level that used to load in 30 seconds, now loads in 4.

I can't find much information on Setun, however, nobody would claim the USSR ever had any sort of edge in computing, despite the country's strong reputation for maths. It is possible the limited electronics available in the USSR were more suited to ternary logic, but I cannot see how.  The advantage of binary logic over other radix is that the number of interconnections is significantly reduced.

Or for example even though laws would guarantee everyone the same rights, if the people upholding the law (courts, police) systemically make decisions and take actions which oppress some group of people, this can also be considered structural oppression, as police and courts are the ones facilitating how society works, they are manifestation of the structures. Other kind of oppression is something that is done by private people, so for example even though women would have the right to vote, some group of angry men intimidating and preventing women of entering the voting place would be non-structural oppression.",

Before the invention of the positional system (units, tens, hundreds etc requiring a concept of zero as a number) the Brahmi numerals were used in India. When the positional system was created the numerals (known as Gwalior numerals after the location of some of the earliest examples) were based on the earlier symbols (although I struggle to see it myself). You can start to see the modern system in these. The Gwalior script and the idea of positional numbers disseminated through Arabia and as time passed three variants of the symbols came in to being - the Sanskrit variant in India and the western and Eastern Arabic numerals. The western Arabic numerals are the ones that travelled on in to europe and then went through two or three more changes over the centuries until what we would recognise as modern numbers came in to being in the fifteenth century.",

And lots of red and a little green together is what we see when we see orange light (since it is closer to red than it is to green). So that is what we see!",

To ensure that data is really gone there are programmes that write junk messages over the data several times so that even if you put the 'do not delete' message back, the original contents arent there, or are badly over written.",

This kind of thing is rare (dependent on tumor type as well), so there are a lot of reports and speculation about causes, but it is very difficult to conclusively figure out what is going on. I'm afraid the answer is disappointing. The best hypothesis that has the most support and scientific interest, and may or may not explain all the cases, is stimulation of the immune system against the cancer. Essentially some event (like a viral infection) that turns the immune system on against the cancer to destroy it (this explains widespread elimination in rapid time).

When an atom splits, sometimes pieces go flying at very high speeds. Picture it sort of as a grenade exploding: little bits of grenade fly everywhere.

The reason why signals from your face reach your brain faster is because they have much less distance to travel. Somatic (touch) information enters the brain through one of the cranial nerves, while information from your fingers travels up your arm, into the spinal chord, and then up to the brain.  Because information processing takes time, your conscious perception of touch is slightly delayed. Your brain is able to recognize that even though the information from different areas arrived at different times, they still represent the same event and thus will be interpreted as happening at the same time.

Hair loss is usually symmetrical because although there are different patterns of receptor/DHT distribution, typically one would think the distribution would be symmetrical bilaterally over the head, any other pattern would point to a non-random receptor/hormone distribution.

Weeds die, are replaced by new weeds, until the plates are under a thick cover of decaying plant matter. A nearby river overflows one year and coats the area in several inches of silt. More plants grow and die, rotting into more mulch over the silt. Wind gradually blows in dirt from elsewhere, and is caught in small drifts against the plants.

The role of 1-octen-3-one in the taste of metal was only determined recently (2006). Full paper: _URL_1_ This chemical is formed by \"skin lipid peroxide reduction and decomposition by low valence metal ions\". So you're not tasting metal but a chemical formed from human skin oils/sweat in the presence of metal. It's theorised that this smell is related to our ability to smell blood which forms the same chemical in contact with skin. However... Tasting metal is a common symptom which may be caused by colds, dental problems, nutrient deficiencies, problems with medication or a large range of conditions that cause distortions in your sense of taste: _URL_0_",

Besides the type of rock, they also need to know the age of the rock. Geologists have ways of measuring how old rocks are. We know that dinosaurs lived between 230-65 million years ago. If you want to find dinosaur fossils, make sure you're not digging someplace where the rocks are too old, or too young. Another factor is figuring out what the environment was like when the rock was formed. Different types of sedimentary rocks form in different places, like on the bottoms of rivers, lakes or oceans.

        "query": "Why is it important that refrigerants in HVAC systems go through phase changes?",
        "response": "Because the latent heat of vaporization is typically much larger than the sensible heat capacity of the refrigerant.  For example, for propane (a common industrial refrigerant) the heat Capacity, Cp, of gaseous propane is 0.064 kJ/molK @ -37 c, whereas the latent heat of vaporization for propane is 16.5kJ/mol. So the latent heat is more than 250 times greater than the sensible heat capacity.  If you don\u2019t condense the vapor and then boil it, you would need to circulate over 250 times more refrigerant than if you take advantage of the latent heat. That would result in a much bigger compressor and corresponding condenser.  Gases make crappy refrigerants. A chilling unit that cools a liquid refrigerant but never boils it in the evaporator (ie now a chiller) is a more efficient single phase system than a gas version as liquids have higher heat capacities than gases and pumping liquids is more efficient than compressing gases. Still not as efficient as a true, 2-phase, refrigerator.",

This is why, for example, iron turns orange when heated by a blacksmith. As things get hotter, the frequency of these EM waves gets higher. So iron that is \u201cwhite hot\u201d is emitting higher frequency light than iron which is only \u201cred hot\u201d because the white hot iron is much, much hotter. Most of the things around us are cold enough that their black body radiation is lower frequency than visible light. Our bodies are right around 35 C, for example, and our black body radiation is in the infrared. However, the sun is much, much hotter. By measuring the frequency and intensity of the light emitted by the sun, we can solve for how hot the surface must be in order to produce that color.

Or perhaps you have something else in mind.  Chemists tend to focus on (b), but (a) is in some respects more interesting. In particular, the closing of shells in real atoms does not lead to any noticeable discontinuities in the binding energy (experimental data are available for atoms with Z up to 20, but the same idea is supported by theory at higher Z). Also, when comparing the \"stabilities\" of electrons in two atoms, say fluorine and neon, you should not forget that they do not have the same nuclear charge.

So when you dump water on an oil fire, the water sinks below the oil, is superheated by the above-water's-boiling-point oil, flashes almost instantly into steam, and creates a huge eruption of steam that hurls the oil above it outward in a cloud of flaming oil droplets that spews out of the pan in all directions, resulting in a massive fireball that will probably burn down your house.

        "query": "How does skipping stones work?",
        "response": "Rocks are able to skip on water because of surface tension. Larger, flatter rocks work better because they increase the contact area between the rock and the water. For two rocks with the same momentum, but one has a larger contact area with the water, the force exerted on the water by the rock with the larger area is distributed over a larger area. This decreases the stress exerted on the water by the rock, making it less likely to overcome the surface tension of the water.",

Before the product is manufactured, they design the product keeping in mind what technologies the factory already has (they only purchase extra machinery or hire contractors in case the cost of it is lower than the expected gain). The engineers plan the product to fit what they already have, and not the opposite. As for knowing which process/material to use, we check the list and see what kind of material we are using and which processes can be applied to those materials and to the shape we want to do. There are higher cost processes and some that are lower cost, and some that are just for a few pieces or some for thousands of pieces... It's not trial and error, it's all planned before being put in action. Well at least that's how I my teachers showed me to do it.

When they see a car coming they only see it with one eye - even turning their heads they can't get the stereoscopic vision predators (like humans) have.  Therefore they can't judge distances well by standing still. The easiest way to judge a distance is to run forward and look at the thing from a different angle (this is called parallax, _URL_0_). The best way to get a good distance on an object is to run directly across it's path. This provides the best angles and most accurate range. It's actually quite neat that squirrels and other animals do trigonometry in their heads without ever thinking about it.

Most of the white population supported it, thinking they were savages preventing the United States from achieving great things. But there was also many humanitarian groups that did not support it. They thought removing the Natives from their land was wrong, but it would be better if they stayed away from the whites. Some thought they would fade away eventually and not to think about it much.

For businesses that aren't closely tied to retail, banking, or government, it's become standard to close the day after Thanksgiving and the day before Christmas, in order to make it easier for employees to spend time with their families, especially when that involves travel. This tends to be contagious - when many businesses are closed and many people are on vacation, that just encourages others to close those same days because it's harder to get anything accomplished when other businesses you work with are closed anyway.

This is what we would expect to see if your hypothesis is correct. However, if the null hypothesis is correct, we'd see this 25% of the time, so the support of your hypothesis is pretty weak. So we flip twice more. 2 more heads. Better for you, but still we'd expect to see this 6.25% of the time. This is about where science starts.

Because of physics, ice crystals want to use some kind of particle as a nucleation point, and they do form around stray yeast cells and other tiny particles. This of course makes the particles effectively larger (since they have some frozen water stuck to them), which makes them easier to filter out. Easier filtering means cheaper filter media and faster flow, so it costs less to filter the beer in preparation for packaging.  ICE = cheaper filtering (in the US - there are ice beers in other parts of the world that are a different thing altogether).",

In answer to the question, Australia has never had \"comparable\" gun laws to the US because we don't have a guaranteed right to have them (as the second amendment gives).

In the UK, people elect representatives to parliament (the British equivalent of Congress). The leader of the biggest party in parliament then becomes the Prime Minister, and that prime minister runs the country and enforces the laws (and I'm skipping some details here).  So in the US it happens all the time that the president is opposed by one or both houses of Congress--that's why Barack Obama couldn't get his ideas for the budget through in the latest crisis. That doesn't really happen in the UK: the person running the country is CHOSEN by the majority of people in parliament.

Those rocks were collected, brought to Earth, and dated using Ar-Ar dating. The three craters that were dated are called Imbrium, Nectaris, and Serenitatis. These three craters all seem to cluster around 3.9 billion years ago (giving rise to the idea of a Late Heavy Bombardment). These ages are not without controversy due to the close proximity of Imbrium and Serenitatis (as a paper I will link to at the bottom recently pointed out).  That being said I'm getting off topic. They were dated because rocks that would have formed during the collision were dated on Earth after being collected in apollo missions 15,16, and 17. The craters that were not dated have been given ages by crater counting (however this technique is entirely model dependent). Links:  _URL_1_ _URL_0_",

This make it mathematical where we can say with ~~little~~ some certainty how many possibilities could arise from this. Math is good in this case because it is not controlled by the laws that govern the universe but instead governs itself with laws we have set it place.

Preignition is bad because it can cause damage to the car's engine. You want the fuel/air mix to ignite when the spark plug fires, and not before. Cars that have high compression ratios, or are turbocharged, or are otherwise optimized for high performance will want premium gas to help them run at their best. Some cars that want premium can also run on regular, although they will do so at reduced performance and fuel economy. But if an engine is not designed to use it, burning premium gas doesn't give any benefit. If you have an ordinary engine, you won't get more power or better economy by using higher-octane gas. Unless your friend has a car that wants it, he's only wasting his money by buying premium.
