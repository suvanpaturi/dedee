You might get idiots honking at you, but don't pay them any attention. Until you are completely and 100% sure of how the vehicle handles and how long it takes to stop it, do this. I'd probably try going kinda fast and braking hard in that parking lot a few times. Just so you know how much you're going to slide around. And always remember to treat the brake pedal like an egg. Step on it too hard and it breaks. Just take everything nice and always give yourself tons and tons of space while behind cars.   Good luck.",

        "response": "The surface of the sun is defined as the layer where the sun emits the majority of electromegnetic radiotion, the so called [photosphere](_URL_1_). The density in that layer is only 10^-7 g/cm3, so its basically a vacuum. The particles there are in a state of plasma, so its no gas nor liquid in the common understanding. Due to the low density it behaves like a very thin gas however. In deeper layers, where the convection of the [granules](_URL_0_) starts, the pressure is high enough to make the material overcritical. This means there is no way to tell the difference between gas (or plasma respectively) and liquid. This is the reason why the sun is sometimes described as a gas ocean.",

        "response": "The term \"lobbying\" originated in the early days of the Republic, when Congressmen usually lived in hotels. A \"lobbyist\" was someone who would wait in the lobby for them to come down so they could speak to them about something. Most lobbying that happens today is just that: a way for people to let Representatives know how they feel about different issues. It's not just corporations who have lobbyists: teachers, doctors, environmentalists, unions, gay-marriage advocates, civil-rights organizations and just about every interest group that you can think of has them.  You might ask why these companies and groups don't just send someone from the company instead of hiring a lobbyist, and that's because lobbyists are much more familiar with how our government works (many of them are former Senators and Congressmen). They have personal relationships with sitting representatives, they know who to talk to if something needs to get done, and generally know the best way to advance their client's interests.",

The thing about intermittent fasting is that it shortens your eating window, so most people end up eating less calories simply because they aren't grazing all day. For some\u2014myself included\u2014it's also easier to *not eat* than it is to *eat less* when trying to lose weight. It makes sense, though, if you think about it. Say you're eating a diet with 1,500 calories. If you try to eat three equal meals, you get three 500-calorie meals. Not very satisfying. With 16/8 intermittent fasting (one of the more popular methods), you'd get two 750-calorie meals. Those are a lot more satiating. **TL;DR:** There's nothing magic about IF, but for some, it's an easier way to restrict calories.",

They were designed before aircraft in general evolved beyond their reconnaissance role, so flying high enough would have completely insulated them from the threat of hostile fire. When aircraft were militarized, the superior carrying capacity of the Zeppelin design spurred the notion of them as good bombers - so after a bit of trial and error the Germans learned to navigate by night to drop their ordnance. While their military impact was minimal, the psychological effect was profound and they served to force the British to retain an inordinate amount of forces in the Home Isles to defend against the threat - fighter units which would have put more of a strain on the heavier-than-air Luftwaffe fleet which was hard-pressed over the trenches.",

So places where the current and electric field are parallel (the battery) are sources for energy flux, and places where the current and the electric field are antiparallel (in a resistor, for example) are sinks for energy flux. Your question about energy flux through a surface is a valid one. What happens if you look at the energy flux through a closed surface in the limit where the radius of the surface is taken to infinity? The only terms which survive are ones where the electric and magnetic fields drop off *at least as slow as* 1/R. This **is** radiation. The field far away from a radiating charge distribution to lowest order looks like a 1/R field, and this happens to be the only term which can transport energy through a closed surface at infinity (because we live in three spatial dimensions).",

So if you want to see something well in the dark, you may do better to look next to it and use your peripheral vision.

If a robbery features robber vs. innocent people, then this is a potential danger, and it's better to respond quick and scare off the robber, than to sneak in and catch them in the act. If the robbery consists of \"robber in a non-occupied warehouse\" then the officer can sneak up and catch them.  Ultimate deciding factor \"people > property\".",

Iodine in the diet is absorbed by the body and concentrated in the thyroid gland. I-131 undergoes beta- decay to yield Xe-131, an electron, and a gamma ray. The electron carries sufficient energy to damage cellular machinery and cause mutations. To prevent radioactive I-131 in the environment from concentrating in the thyroid, likely damaging or killing it, an appropriate dose of Potassium Iodide can be ingested in order to saturate the gland with stable Iodine.  A daily dose taken for 6 weeks can provide some degree of thyroid protection during the early days of a nuclear emergency. After 6 weeks, ~99% of the I-131 will have decayed, and use of the supplement is discontinued.",

There are a few reasons - SLC has better access to the jet stream coming from the Pacific. LV is at the very edge of \"monsoon season\" area, so the monsoon's effects are not as dramatic.

Unless you live that high up (and there are only 14 states that even *have* peaks much above 7k feet) then you're going to feel a difference, and you ascend to that pressure so fast that you don't have much time to adjust. So there's some just basic pressure shock involved.  Airplane air is also generally *very* low humidity, and that can dry you out and require additional water intake to offset, which most people don't get on the plane.

It needs to be flat and thin so there is enough room to set up interference effects inside the layer that are steady over a big enough area for you to see them.  The vapor pressure doesn't matter much, but the surface tension does. Oil spreads out on water to make a thin layer thanks to a low surface tension. Water has a high surface tension and tends to make a thicker, rounder layer when sitting on a surface.

RWD is better for acceleration, because weight shifts backwards under acceleration, so shifting to the drive wheels will give them better traction. FWD cars are nose heavy. The ideal balance for handling is 50/50 (imagine a pivot in the center of the car, it would be easier to turn if the weight is equally balanced on both sides, right?), and FWD cars will tend to have a poor weight balance due to the entire drivetrain being located in the front of the car. Further on handling, RWD cars have better balance between understeer and oversteer.

This population (Unionists) were very active in opposing home rule in Ireland and were effective at keeping the 6 counties of Northern Ireland part of the United Kingdom. These 6 counties were strategically selected as it was thought that the 'native' Irish population (Nationalists) would never be a large enough percentage to vote for a United Ireland. Interestingly, many Unionists speak about Ulster instead of Northern Ireland, which actually consists of 9 counties and Nationalists are the majority overall.",

        "response": "If sufficient force is applied to the material to stretch the polymers beyond their elastic limit, they will be permanently deformed. When the change is not uniform throughout the material it will cause it to curl as one 'side' of the ribbon is now 'longer' than the other. Materials that don't break down, i.e. satin ribbons, will not curl effectively as they're made of individual threads. An interesting demonstration of a similar concept can be done by heating bimetallic strips. One side of the strip expands at a different rate than the other, causing it to curl. This property has practical applications in timekeeping, thermostats, thermometers, heat engines, and electronics.

Fever is a symptom your body is fighting an infection and are caused by chemicals called pyrogens flowing in the bloodstream. Pyrogens make their way to the hypothalamus in the brain. When pyrogens bind to certain receptors in the hypothalamus, body temperature rises. Many illness-causing microbes are best adapted to thrive at the body's normal temperature. A fever raises the temperature beyond which certain microbes need to reproduce. The higher temperature also kicks the immune system into high gear, spurring the rapid production of white blood cells to fight the infection.  The reason that you feel bad when you have an infection is not directly related to higher body temperature. It's a self preservation mechanism to get you to rest and spend as little energy with other activities. The higher temperature is not the cause, it's a symptom.",

So the air touching the grill gets very hot and rises (because it's less dense, which is why hot air balloons work), mixing with the less-hot air above (this mixing is what causes the lines to be squiggly). But if that's all that is happening, the squiggly lines would be invisible. But light [refracts](_URL_0_) when crossing between two volumes with different densities, so the light bends a little as it passes through the heated air. This causes the squiggly lines to appear, like the picture of the water glass in the link for refraction.

During the same period, video game sales have been rising steadily. It's possible that these two trends are completely unrelated, but it seems exceedingly likely based on this trend that if video games have an effect on violent behavior, it is either in the other direction, or it is not significant on a societal scale.

To add to AlloLay's great answer, another reason why humans don't need to have the sperm longevity that other organisms have is that we have a LOT of sex. It's ridiculous how many intercourse sessions we have per pregnancy. Also, human females are fertile every month rather than every year and our social groups tend to favor kin-selection. Our genetic diversity is pretty low and traditionally a group of humans are related enough that sperm competitions isn't a priority. Even if a man helped to raise a child that wasn't really his, many of his genes would still be present in the kid because of the relatedness of a typical hunter-gatherer band of humans.

Disclaimer: I don't want to criticize too much, but it's possible that the difference they are seeing has to do with the inherent difference between the groups... people who don't practice meditation are likely to be different \"kinds\" of people and therefore have different brain physiology, so you can't assume that those brains are identical at the start. This study is merely correlational and can't say that meditation \"causes\" structural changes. Edit: typo",

Always fascinating looking back at those sources discussing what the Soviet Navy will look like entering the 21st Century, and also how effective the Soviets were at frustrating Western speculation on the missions and strategies of their fleets and vessels. Frustrating to the amateur historian is that these same confused and debating sources seem to be the ones that are still widely referred to even after the collapse of the USSR.  Maybe its more of a POV lesson. I can now feel the same sense of futility a Western naval officer might have felt in trying to discover if the Soviets still regarded the attacking of Atlantic shipping lanes as their primary naval mission despite their 70s/80s tendency to engage simultaneously in \"showing the flag\" in Third World ports. *and* appear to engage in defensive posturing in home waters.

However, the usefulness of a massively huge screen is limited, which takes us to the second part of your question. Current high-resolution (\u201cretina\u201d) screens are already at the point where the unaided human eye cannot distinguish individual pixels anymore. It's unlikely that resolution (in the sense of pixels per square cm) will get significantly increased in the foreseeable future. To take it to an extreme though, what's the smallest pixels you could make in theory? One pixel per atom/molecule, surely. As long as you can find a material in which you can excite the electrons of specific individual atoms in such a way that they give off the desired wavelength of light (= color), you're golden.

What you are left with is a pure sugar syrup at about 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). When it cools, you have hard candy. To make Pop Rocks, the hot sugar mixture is allowed to mix with carbon dioxide gas at about 600 pounds per square inch (psi). The carbon dioxide gas forms tiny, 600-psi bubbles in the candy. Once it cools, you release the pressure and the candy shatters, but the pieces still contain the high-pressure bubbles (look at a piece with a magnifying glass to see the bubbles). When you put the candy in your mouth, it melts (just like hard candy) and releases the bubbles with a loud POP!

This refers to the practice of Gematria, calculating numbers from the letters used to spell words. The most common explanation relies on transliterating the greek Neron Kaisar into Hebrew (NRWN QSR) - thus, the number refers to Emperor Nero. This works particularly well because N, \"nun\", is worth 50, so if you translate \"Nero Caesar\" from Latin, you get instead \"NRW QSR\", which adds up to 616, the other number present in some manuscripts.
