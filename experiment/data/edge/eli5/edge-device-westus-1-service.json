The different emission/absorption peaks that can be measured are general characteristic to a particular material (though not always).  Combine this with our thermodynamic knowledge of what it's like on places like Titan, and you can start to understand what physical state the materials are in. So, for example, we know there's liquid methane on Titan because it's so cold there that gaseous methane would condense out.",

It is worth noting that the period from the initial deployment of personal firearms in large numbers in the Hussite Wars of the early 15th century to the mid 16th century (when firearms become both more common stronger) plate armour became more common than ever even as it became more metallurgically advanced (and, people like me would say, more artistically refined). It was not the initial introduction of firearms but their further refinement and their mass deployment in the late 16th and 17th century (as well as changes in army composition and tactics that caused the gradual reduction and eventual abandonment of armour.",

Additionally, it is theorized that we adapt to moving surfaces like airport moving sidewalks and escalators, with the expectation of their movement. When our brain perceives we are then moving onto one, the lack of expected movement, we have associated with it through experience, throws us off.

If you wake up while in REM sleep or soon after you are more easily able to recall dreams.  Norepinephrine levels - norepinephrine is a neuro chemical that aids in memory, while asleep you typically produce less of it. Perhaps your friends produce more of it in their sleeping state than you do.  Why do we have a tendency to forget dreams? Nobody know for sure but a leading theory suggests that remembering dreams might be a disadvantage causing false memories in your day to day life. Say you dream about doing something important but are unable to distinguish between reality and your dream, you might end up not doing something that you should have done because you think you've done it already.",

The standard use of midnight as the start of the day is a consequence of the Roman system of time which divided the daylight time into 12 equal parts, in which the mid-point (roughly Noon) was used as the reference point for the whole day. Times during the day were expressed relative to Noon eg \"2 a.m. meant 2 hours before Noon (nominally our current 10am). They divided night time into 4 \"watches\" of roughly 3 hours each. Under this system, the time at which you cease to be closest to one day's Noon and begin to be closer to the next day's Noon is half way through the night.",

(thanks /u/AdarTan) An ARM application simply wouldn't run on the x86 architecture. At least not a native applications which is why Java or .Net applications run on everything that has Java or .Net. The Application itself is not compiled (translation from source code that humans can read and write to 1s and 0s) for Windows or AMD64 but for the Java Virtual Machine (and whatever Microsoft calls their .Net stuff) which is a virtual machine that then runs your application with code for your platform (CPU architecture and OS).",

So say the average home user's connection can handle 20Mbps in total, having a symmetrical connection with 10/10 up/down means that most of the upload speed is going to waste most of the time, because they barely upload anything, but it means their download speeds are slower so it takes longer to download the latest movie/game/whatever.

What likely happened is the sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) decomposed into sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) which occurs at about 122 degrees Fahrenheit (50 degrees Celsius).  This reaction proceeds as follows: 2 NaHCO3 (solid) -- > Na2CO3 (solid) + CO2 (gas) + H2O (liquid) The tablet wouldn't require much of the sodium bicarbonate to decompose to fill the volume of your packet.

First of all, wax is intended to protect the ear by sticking to foreign bodies and preventing them from going deeper into the canal. Wax also acts as an antibacterial and helps prevent infections! But if you don't clean them, won't there be TOO MUCH wax?... Rarely. Our ears are designed in such a way that wax is constantly being pushed out on its own. By sticking Q-tips in your ear in an attempt to clean them, you are really just pushing the wax deeper. This could cause the formation of a plug, which can lead to conditions such as decreased hearing, tinnitus, and vertigo. Not to mention every time you stick something into the canal you run the risk of permanently damaging your ear drum.

Your vocal folds protect your airway, so anytime you cough or clear your throat, you are pushing them together, just like you do for speech. You also build up subglottic pressure by adducting (pushing together) your vocal folds to aid in activities such as lifting weights or pooping. So yes, anytime you poop, you are using your speech musculature.  Consider trach patients who have not been able to use their voices for long periods of time.

There, circulation is restricted and evaporation can bring salinity into the range where salts can precipitate.  You need a pretty high evap coefficient to precipitate salt by the way.

Soaps were cheap and advertised relentlessly in the press. Cleanliness, moreover, was celebrated as a key aspect of respectable Englishness and central to the so-called 'civilising process' in imperial territories. I'm sure there were plenty of people who bathed fairly infrequently in the nineteenth century, but its certainly not a period I'd associate with markedly poor personal hygiene.

If a black hole continues accreting mass, then obviously the maximum size of black holes will increase, and it's broadly estimated that 1-10% of a given galaxy's mass will eventually enter its central black hole over the next 10^30 years.",

When you let go, that potential energy is converted to kinetic energy in the arrow.  In general, using three arrows instead of one means that you would be using the same total amount of stored potential energy to accelerate three arrows, meaning the kinetic energy would be divided among them (minus some small amount lost to accelerate the bowstring, dissipated as the bowstring vibrates after the shot).

There are several ways that companies track down gold. The one I am most familiar with is sampling groundwater or surface water for gold or minerals often found with gold then looking for the source.

A simple example if you take an ice cube tray and fill it with water and put it in your freezer as it turns to ice it will lose entropy and gain order, but the outside of the freezer gains entropy in the form of heat released. The net will be an increase in entropy but for a localized area it decreases. The same is true for the Earth as it is not a closed system (see the Sun). But even if it was closed as long as the net entropy increases a local area can lose entropy thus evolution is permissible both in the small frame of the earth and the larger frame of the whole universe.",

It will no longer drift away when all the remaining angular momentum has been drawn. Okay, *almost* all of it. The Earth will still rotate slowly and the length of the day will match the orbital period of the Moon, so that they always show the same face to each other. This is mutual tidal locking, like the Pluto-Charon system. The Moon will still be close enough to be in orbit around Earth by then. The timescale for this to happen is tens of billions of years. But the Sun only has 7 billion years to live and it may engulf the Earth during its red giant phase. So the Moon won't have time to make Earth tidally locked, let aside leave us. _URL_0_",

        "response": "States of matter only apply to collections of atoms. Single atoms are not solids, liquids or gases. An isolated atom does not have a temperature or pressure, these quantities are only meaningful in the context of multiple atoms. When you dissolve a solid into a liquid, assuming it completely dissolves and doesn't leave solid particles behind, it's a liquid solution. When the solid dissolved all of its atoms/molecules were separated and mixed into the solvent. All of the solid properties were lost, and the result is just a liquid made of more than one species of atom/molecule. If a large solid breaks into smaller pieces that are still solid but disperse themselves throughout the liquid, it's called a suspension or a colloid, depending on the size of the dispersoid. The bottom line is that \"state of matter\" is not a fundamental, immutable property that atoms carry with them. States of matter are emergent behaviors that depend on the interactions between atoms.",

A wall with some sort of insulation in it would be better at absorbing sound waves, and a thin wall would have sound waves pass through it. With bass frequencies, they are literally longer than higher frequencies. In technical terms, the period of a low frequency is longer than that of a higher frequency. Really low frequencies have a period that's longer than a bus! This means they are not easily reflected or absorbed by a wall.

A girl however has to say female only so it gives her a place to reject males and keep the flow of guys down. To many guys would love to have a female roommate so they could entertain the idea of getting laid. As soon as guys see an ad with a female looking for a roommate they call, unless there is a disclaimer looking only for girls. This helps keeps the guys away and since girls don't call when its a guys apt then its a moot point to put in the ad. Personally after having lived with female roommate I prefer guys.

Ask enough people what stations they listen to, and you can extrapolate it with pretty good confidence. Another way is by using those call-in contests that you hear radio stations having all the time. There's a well established percentage of people who are likely to call in to the station for contests, and so by keeping track of how many people participate, you can roughly judge how many people are listening at that particular time.

        "response": "The movement of electrons through a system is what we call electricity. A batteries job is to store these electrons for later use. Electrons can have a wide range of speeds. A slow case: we know that electrons move when there is a current flow in a wire, but the speed at which the electrons themselves move in the wire -- the so-called electron drift velocity -- surprises most people. For example, for a copper wire of radius 1 mm carrying a steady current of 10 amps, the drift velocity is only about 0.024 cm/sec. So, basically the speed at which your cell phone battery is limited to the speed at which the electrons can travel through the wire on your charger. The larger the wire's diameter, the more current (amps) that it can withstand. You may think to yourself \"ok, why don't we just make the wire bigger?\" The more current you have going into a battery, the hotter it gets. This could then lead to battery damage, fire, or even an explosion. Hope this helps.",

Now, what separates non-ionzing from ionizing? Well the former can't knock electrons from atoms and thus can't make ions. Now to cancer, cancer is a genetic mutation where the DNA that controls cell reproduction is damaged and runs uncontrollably. In order to have this happen, you have to mess up the bonds in the DNA, which means you need enough energy to strip away electrons.

Since then it has become so ingrained in the culture of \"eating out\" that laws have been passed allowing servers to be paid less than minimum wage because they are expected to make up the difference in tips.

Second, a bunch of parts of the immune system work better at slightly higher temperatures. The cells that eat bacteria and viruses, for example, are better at it when the temperature is a just a little higher than our regular body temp.  So when we have an infection, our body raises its temperature a little bit to make life harder for the bugs, and easier for the things that kill them.  & nbsp; It's similar for other symptoms.

When the pressure from the CO2 gas gets up there, your stomach releases the pressure, usually as a belch.

It also helps absorb water and waste products (toxins) as it passes through your intestines.  When you don't eat enough fiber, you don't have enough undigested food left over to add to your poop, so your poop can't absorb enough water and it ends up being really hard.

As a result, it's hard to pin down exactly, because maybe a 5 year old is good at some tasks, and a chimp is better at others, and how do you say which is more intelligent when the abilities don't exactly match up. Which isn't to say that intelligence doesn't exist at all. There's got to be some \"thing\" which humans have more of than herrings, but it's not easy to pin down.",

If you take a cloud of gas in space and spin it, it will form into a disc. This disc started clumping together around particularly dense bits of gas or large bits of dust.

By calculating the angle it moves in the sky over the course of 6 months and using basic trigonometry you can find the distance. [These diagrams show how](_URL_1_). For further away stars, a mixture of techniques are used. First, using [type IA supernovae](_URL_2_) help determine distance. Because of the mechanism, the explosion is always roughly the same intensity. We can use this to determine how far it is as we known how the intensity falls with distance. [Cepheid variables](_URL_0_) are also used. These are stars that pulse over time, with the period of pulsing very strongly correlated to its absolute luminosity. Given this and a few other parameters, the distance can be found again by using the luminosity. There are several other methods, but these three were the main ones.",

They will eventually settle out of the line of sight, which is why they don't steadily accumulate throughout our lifetimes (although they do become more common as we age).  That said, the sudden appearance of LOTS of floaters, or the presence of other symptoms with floaters (perceived flashes of light when there aren't any, loss of peripheral vision), can be a sign of severe eye conditions, like partial retinal detachment.

This is useful, because it means that all you need to do is match the movement of the speaker cone to the shape of that waveform, and you can re-create it. Going the other direction, when you record sound you record the continous waveform (a microphone functions exactly like a speaker, just driven in reverse), and you can actually, through a process called the [fourier transformation](_URL_0_) break a complex sound (like say, Pavarotti's voice) down into its constituent sine waves for analysis/modification.",

So, in a recession or depression, have the government inject cash by either spending a lot of money on public works or lowering taxes. That's what the New Deal was.

If many of these molecules are near each other, they will not (generally) form hydrogen bonds because the carbon atoms do not attract hydrogen as much as oxygen atoms for example.  On the stickier side of things, sugars such as glucose have many oxygen atoms on the outside of the molecule. Oxygen is much better at attracting hydrogen than carbon, so other glucose molecules nearby (or for that matter any other substances with hydrogen atoms) will be very attracted to to sugars. This hydrogen bonding is what makes sugar sticky.  In short, oils generally have hydrogen-to-carbon bonds, which are not as strong as hydrogen-to-oxygen bonds in other substances.

The Belgrano when attacked was outside of the former Exclusion Zone. For some reason there is a belief that is a war crime because it was not in a war zone. However, I've never read anything that supports that argument. One argument is that the ship was returning to port and thus wasn't a legit target, but once again how is that a war crime? How does sailing back to port render one no longer a military target?

So you adjust whatever you can on the bike to allow more air, or restrict fuel, or both. Then you run it on the dyno again and compare the results to your first run.

If something is encoded as one set but mistakenly interpreted as another, some characters can get interpreted as another character, or even more than one character. This typically doesn't happen to to the most common characters (which are roman letters, numbers and basic punctuations) which share the same numbers in all encoding schemes, but once you get up into the range that apostrophes/quotes inhabit, you've reached numbers that can be interpreted different ways depending on the encoding used.",

When your computer runs low on memory (because it's all allocated to this wacko program) it starts using disk as memory which is really really slow, making things worse.  Rebooting causes the computer to clear the memory and start fresh where the whole thing can happen again over time. It's incredibly difficult to track down leaks as the OS will not report what's using the memory accurately.

        "response": "Basically, they get more experience at writing code for that hardware and learn how to optimize it. It's like getting more practice with a set of paints. You don't get more colors to work with, but you learn how better to use the ones you do have.",

        "query": "Is it possible for two embryos with different fathers to fuse and create a human chimera?",
        "response": "[Human chimeras](_URL_1_) are [definently possible](_URL_0_). They are usually discovered when people start testing for paternity or crimes, but you can have more obvious phenotypes (like eye color). Remember that each sperm only cares half of the genetic information of the father, so even if it is the same father the fused embryos can have a very different genetic makeups in different subsets of its cells. Two fathers is a little tricker, you would need rapid fertilization from two separate males. Even if that did happen, chimeras are rare enough where I would guess this would be extraordinarily rare.  Anecdotally, as single cell sequencing technologies progress rapidly I suspect we will discover that this phenomenon is more common than previously thought. Single cell sequencing allows us to examine the DNA or RNA of each cell individually, so if an organism is a chimera we see odd data come out the other side (it looks like someone screwed up and put multiple samples in the same tube for sequencing).",

        "query": "Is there an explanation behind the \"chills\" we get when we listen to a certain song?",
        "response": "This has a lot to do with the body's physiological response to emotion. When you experience something [invoking strong-emotions](_URL_0_) there is more epinephrine and, more importantly, norepinephrine released into your bloodstream. This causes the \"chills\" in the same way we get \"goose bumps\", it's a mechanism of fight-or-flight. This also means the amygdalae are activated also. I would also like to point out that the fight or flight is more appropriately fight, flight, fawn or freeze (4F). So, when I say \"fight or flight\" I'm just talking about the physiological response, not that you actually feel threatened - just perceiving an increase in the same hormones.",

        "response": "All organisms in the world experience DNA damage due to radioactivity, UV exposure, free radicals, etc. Sometimes this damage causes a single stranded break in your DNA (Pretty bad), and sometimes it causes the DNA strand to completely break (Double stranded break, very bad!). Radiation causes double stranded breaks, which is why it is so dangerous. (Almost) every organism also has some way of dealing with this damage. How some organisms are \"resistant\" to this is by having these same systems that also happen to be more efficient. The most common form of repair in bacteria is the [RecBCD](_URL_1_) system, but every organisms RecBCD has varying degrees of how well it works. Those that have very high resistances to radioactivity have overactive DNA repair mechanisms, which [sometimes also act in different ways than the less effective ones](_URL_0_). It's a very cool line of research!",

But burn a whole bunch of that building to transform substances into toxic smoke, and then bring the whole thing down in a massive dust-producing implosion, and the massive impact atomizes a lot of these components, freeing them to travel and ride concrete dust into peoples' throats and lungs, often for years afterward when rubble is moved and dust is disturbed again.",
