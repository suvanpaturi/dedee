In this context, appraisal refers to the estimation of an asset's worth, while a notary is a legal officer who authenticates documents.\n\n Appraisal plays a crucial role in determining the market value, useful life, cost of production, and other factors that influence the assessment of impairment for intangible and long-lived assets. On the other hand, notaries are involved to ensure the legitimacy and validity of documents related to these assets during the documentation process.\n\n In summary, appraisal is more about evaluating and quantifying the worth of an asset, while notaries authenticate and verify the documents pertaining to that asset.

Determine the risk-free interest rate (r).\n   2. Calculate the stock price volatility (\u03c3\u00b2).\n   3. Find the time to expiration (t) in years.\n   4. Determine the dividend yield (q).\n   5. Use these variables and the strike price (S) in the Black-Scholes formula: C = S * N(d1) - X * e^(-r*t) * N(d2).\n\n   Where, d1 = [ln(S/X) + (r + \u03c3\u00b2 / 2)] / (\u03c3 * sqrt(t)) and d2 = d1 - \u03c3 * sqrt(t).
