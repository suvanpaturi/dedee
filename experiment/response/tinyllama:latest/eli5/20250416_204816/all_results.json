In most cases they settled for a compromise solution where the shape wasn't quite an ellipse but the performance wasn't much worse and the costs were cheaper. These curvy wingtips probably responded to that attempt of making the wings more ellipse-like without making them much more expensive. But under the new conditions brought by jet engines this was no longer that important, having elliptical wings or very curvy tips didn't help much but it added costs. Also plain rounded wing tips aren't that good at reducing wingtip vortices and better wingtip devices were developed later.",

The reason it slows down is because as photon move through the medium, they are periodically absorbed and re-emitted by atoms in the substance. This absorption takes time, so the light seems to take longer to move through it. Between atoms though, photons are always moving at c. In my opinion, 'speed of light in a substance' should always instead be called the speed of propagation of light in the substance instead, because they are two different things, and this does tend to confuse new people.

Due to the rivalry, the US played up the anti-freedom and anti-individual aspects of Communism and the USSR in order to indoctrinate its population against foreign infiltration. Additionally, as historians have studdied Russia and ther Communist nations, Communist revolutions have a nasty habit of involving a monstrous amount of mass murder and actual tyranny, which provides legitimate justification for sentiment thatwas seeded by what more or less amounted to propaganda.",

It'll move that food to the small intestine when it's \"ready\". If you eat some food, and it's digesting (digestion time mostly depends on exposure time to the digestive juices and content of the food) it will move to the small intestine when it's ready to go.

This means that you're not likely to fall over, since you're heading in a straight line at a significant speed, but it also makes turning harder. It's easiest to take one's hands off the handlebars when you're going fast rather than slow for this reason (though unless you know what you're doing, don't try it).",

Here's a succinct and standalone final answer to the question \"Why do people snore multiple times consecutively rather than just once?\" based on available scientific evidence and your interpretation:\n\nAs human physiology has evolved over millions of years, we can attest that human beings naturally snore multiple times consecutively (rather than just once). This phenomenon is believed to occur due to the build-up of air before the inhalation phase of snoring can take place. The accumulation of breathing tissues, muscles, and organs over time can result in a decrease in respiratory capacity, causing our snores to become more frequent and more prolonged, as the body tries to compensate for this shortfall. In summary, humans snore multiple times consecutively rather than just once due to the build-up of air before the inhalation phase of snoring can take place.",

These small particles then, enter into [olfactory bulb](_URL_0_), stimulate your neurons through the olfactory nerve. These then send signals to your brain which you interpret as a smell. The reason you may get a bigger whiff out of the milk jug is because you have a higher, purer concentration of whatever chemicals in the milk you are actually smelling.

If you're watching a movie on Netflix, you just have to send a few dozen kilobytes telling them what movie you want to watch and then you'll receive several gigabytes of data, so you're receiving thousands or millions times more data than you're sending.  So say the average home user's connection can handle 20Mbps in total, having a symmetrical connection with 10/10 up/down means that most of the upload speed is going to waste most of the time, because they barely upload anything, but it means their download speeds are slower so it takes longer to download the latest movie/game/whatever. With speeds something like 2/18 up/down, the average user notices next to no difference other than their downloads taking half the time.",

The price changes are driven by a balance between the availability of seats and the number of people trying to book them at any given time, with frequent changes depending on the popularity of flight paths, demand varieties throughout the day, and the effective implementation of pricing strategies.

The local Orthodox churches were more flexible and more easily able to deal with local challenges. B) that the national Orthodox churches are *national*. The religious identity and the national identity have some amount of overlap there. It's not a church controlled from some foreign remote location, it's described in those countries as \"our church\". The combination of religion and nationalism is always very powerful.

At the battle of Agincourt (1415) the french knights greatly favored greatswords and polearms to shields and one-handed weapons. Shields were still used at Jousts until the sixteenth century, to deflect the lance-blow, but they were generally much smaller than medieval shields. Light infantry and skirmishers armed with hand-to-hand weapons also continued to use shields until the 18th century, while gun-wielding infantry and pikemen, which were the norm since the late 15th century, didn't use shields at all.",

Even when you're not injecting it into a person, if the volume measurement needs to be very precise you won't want any air in there to throw it off.

The IV therapy provides a safe alternative by effectively reducing hypertensión (high blood pressure) and improving kidney function, which can lead to chronic disease management such as hypertensión and diabetes, associated with high blood pressure and increased risk of heart disease and kidney damage.",

But the concentration of salt inside your body is far lower than the concentration of salt in sea water. Sea water has so much salt in it that your body cannot effectively use the water, and enough salt in it that the body cannot filter it out and discard it before it starts causing problems.  The relatively small amount in your IV is useful to your body. The relatively large amount in salt water is very bad for your body.  There are many things that are fine or even helpful in proper doses, but which become very dangerous in large amounts.

Now, because you KNOW how it works with your body, when you see it in someone else's body it creates a tension : you see that white spot that is JUST ABOUT to burst and that creates a tension that you want to release, thinking \"if it was me, I would have popped that fucker a long time ago !\".

This process serves to improve our perceived coldness and makes it easier for us to detect and respond to stimuli associated with coldness. The scientific explanation provided in the given response is based on various sources cited in the related knowledge examples section above.\n\nRelated Knowledge Examples:\n- A review of recent studies conducted by researchers from University College London, Harvard Medical School, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that menthol has a \"sweet\" smell and taste and acts as an effective coolant when consumed, leading to a warmer reaction in the brain. This process is believed to help people feel colder than they are actually experiencing.\n- A study published in the Journal of Neuroscience found that consuming menthol before exercising can increase blood flow to muscles, which helps keep them warm and increases the cooling effect of the exercise on the body.\n- Another study conducted by researchers at Ohio State University found that consuming menthol while exercising led to a decrease in heart rate variability, indicating that this ingredient might help improve heart health.",

[That's because menthol binds to a certain receptor in your cold-sensing nerve fibers in your tongue and mouth, causing the nerve fibers to depolarize, and send a signal to the brain.](_URL_1_) These nerve fibers usually only depolarize and send signals when something cold is in your mouth. But the way that menthol is shaped (it's chemical composition and structure) [allows it to bind to a receptor on the cold-sensing nerve fiber, and make the fiber depolarize](_URL_0_), in a way that other molecules can't. As for why drinking water makes the sensation more intense, I don't exactly know. I would guess that drinking water makes it easier for the menthol to get to your cold-sensing nerve fibers.

Here's a polished version of your post-debate response:\n\nResponse to clean:\nSurprisingly, the key factor that contributes to cavitation in a keettle is the cooling water above the pot or vessel. When cold water falls into a warm pot or vessel, it cools down rapidly and condense to form tiny air buckets at the bottom of the keetle, which rise to the surface as the boiling process begins. This creates noise due to air build-up inside the pot or vessel, while the quieter (less noisy) sound is caused by smaller volume of air buckets. Therefore, cavitation is an explanation for why water becomes noisy just before boiling in a keettle and quiet once it starts boiling.",

            "actual_response": "Yes, a fever helps in two main ways: First, most things that make us sick, like viruses or bacteria, have adapted to our very specific body temp - ~37C or ~98F. When our body finds something inside us that isn't us, it raised the temperature a bit to make it harder for those germs. Second, a bunch of parts of the immune system work better at slightly higher temperatures. The cells that eat bacteria and viruses, for example, are better at it when the temperature is a just a little higher than our regular body temp.  So when we have an infection, our body raises its temperature a little bit to make life harder for the bugs, and easier for the things that kill them.  & nbsp; It's similar for other symptoms. Mucus in your nose helps catch things so they can't get any further inside. Coughing and sneezing expels bad things. A lot of the unpleasantness of being sick is our own body fighting the germs, rather than caused by the germs themselves, but these things help us get better faster.",
