            "actual_response": "A 400whp RWD car is not any more or less powerful than a 400whp FWD car. That said... RWD is better for acceleration, because weight shifts backwards under acceleration, so shifting to the drive wheels will give them better traction. FWD cars are nose heavy. The ideal balance for handling is 50/50 (imagine a pivot in the center of the car, it would be easier to turn if the weight is equally balanced on both sides, right?), and FWD cars will tend to have a poor weight balance due to the entire drivetrain being located in the front of the car. Further on handling, RWD cars have better balance between understeer and oversteer. When a car is turning, a FWD car will tend to plow forward if you approach/exceed the traction limits, while you can rotate a RWD car with the throttle and keep it on course.",

In most cases they settled for a compromise solution where the shape wasn't quite an ellipse but the performance wasn't much worse and the costs were cheaper. These curvy wingtips probably responded to that attempt of making the wings more ellipse-like without making them much more expensive. But under the new conditions brought by jet engines this was no longer that important, having elliptical wings or very curvy tips didn't help much but it added costs. Also plain rounded wing tips aren't that good at reducing wingtip vortices and better wingtip devices were developed later.",

This absorption takes time, so the light seems to take longer to move through it. Between atoms though, photons are always moving at c. In my opinion, 'speed of light in a substance' should always instead be called the speed of propagation of light in the substance instead, because they are two different things, and this does tend to confuse new people.

The modern animosity towards Communism was because it was the ideology of the Soviet Union, who was a rival to the US and its Allies after WW2. Due to the rivalry, the US played up the anti-freedom and anti-individual aspects of Communism and the USSR in order to indoctrinate its population against foreign infiltration. Additionally, as historians have studdied Russia and ther Communist nations, Communist revolutions have a nasty habit of involving a monstrous amount of mass murder and actual tyranny, which provides legitimate justification for sentiment thatwas seeded by what more or less amounted to propaganda.",

Although I admit I find it funny as I often have similar thoughts.  Generally speaking, much of what is used as primary sources today is, to put it simply, junk or trash. For example, there is a very talented historian at Rice University named Tani Barlow that does a lot of research exploring the depiction of women in Chinese ads in the 20s. It's fascinating work but the majority of her work uses sources that most people at the time would have considered completely irrelevant or uninteresting. However, they are valuable windows into the cultural space of the time period she studies.

But I can tell you as a historian who primarily uses primary sources for research it's rather difficult to ensure that your diary will be a valuable resource for future historians. Although I admit I find it funny as I often have similar thoughts.  Generally speaking, much of what is used as primary sources today is, to put it simply, junk or trash. For example, there is a very talented historian at Rice University named Tani Barlow that does a lot of research exploring the depiction of women in Chinese ads in the 20s.

This means that you're not likely to fall over, since you're heading in a straight line at a significant speed, but it also makes turning harder.

On a molecular level, the Cellulose is made of D-Glucose linked by 1-4 glycosidic bonds. This just means that the cellulose chain is made of many molecules of this simple sugar linked together in one long chain, called a fibril.

Smell is basically small particles of whatever it is you are smelling, entering your oral and nasal cavity (Taste plays a role in smell - meaning when you smell a fart you are kinda tasting it too..). These small particles then, enter into [olfactory bulb](_URL_0_), stimulate your neurons through the olfactory nerve. These then send signals to your brain which you interpret as a smell. The reason you may get a bigger whiff out of the milk jug is because you have a higher, purer concentration of whatever chemicals in the milk you are actually smelling. Whereas in your cereal, that smell is diluted by the sugary, wheaty smell of cornflakes. SOURCE: Dental education, numerous anatomy and physiology classes.",

The religious identity and the national identity have some amount of overlap there. It's not a church controlled from some foreign remote location, it's described in those countries as \"our church\". The combination of religion and nationalism is always very powerful.

At the battle of Agincourt (1415) the french knights greatly favored greatswords and polearms to shields and one-handed weapons. Shields were still used at Jousts until the sixteenth century, to deflect the lance-blow, but they were generally much smaller than medieval shields. Light infantry and skirmishers armed with hand-to-hand weapons also continued to use shields until the 18th century, while gun-wielding infantry and pikemen, which were the norm since the late 15th century, didn't use shields at all.",

Now, because you KNOW how it works with your body, when you see it in someone else's body it creates a tension : you see that white spot that is JUST ABOUT to burst and that creates a tension that you want to release, thinking \"if it was me, I would have popped that fucker a long time ago !\".

[That's because menthol binds to a certain receptor in your cold-sensing nerve fibers in your tongue and mouth, causing the nerve fibers to depolarize, and send a signal to the brain.](_URL_1_) These nerve fibers usually only depolarize and send signals when something cold is in your mouth. But the way that menthol is shaped (it's chemical composition and structure) [allows it to bind to a receptor on the cold-sensing nerve fiber, and make the fiber depolarize](_URL_0_), in a way that other molecules can't. As for why drinking water makes the sensation more intense, I don't exactly know. I would guess that drinking water makes it easier for the menthol to get to your cold-sensing nerve fibers.

            "actual_response": "Yes, a fever helps in two main ways: First, most things that make us sick, like viruses or bacteria, have adapted to our very specific body temp - ~37C or ~98F. When our body finds something inside us that isn't us, it raised the temperature a bit to make it harder for those germs. Second, a bunch of parts of the immune system work better at slightly higher temperatures. The cells that eat bacteria and viruses, for example, are better at it when the temperature is a just a little higher than our regular body temp.  So when we have an infection, our body raises its temperature a little bit to make life harder for the bugs, and easier for the things that kill them.  & nbsp; It's similar for other symptoms. Mucus in your nose helps catch things so they can't get any further inside. Coughing and sneezing expels bad things. A lot of the unpleasantness of being sick is our own body fighting the germs, rather than caused by the germs themselves, but these things help us get better faster.",
