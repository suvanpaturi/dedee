This means that the full power is available immediately from a standstill, unlike internal combustion engines that need to build up power through increasing RPMs. Additionally, electric vehicles",

            "actual_response": "A electric engine can provide full torque (the force that cause the rotation of the tires) from then start to rotate from stationary. A combustion engine have low tork at low RPM and max torque and a quite high RPM To be more correct the electric engines torque will change when the rpm changes but is it a flatter curve then for a combustion engine so in most/all RPM depending on the combustion engine a electric engine have more torque and therefore faster acceleration",
