This means that electric vehicles can achieve maximum torque from a standstill, providing rapid acceleration. In contrast, gasoline engines need to build up RPMs to reach their peak",

A combustion engine have low tork at low RPM and max torque and a quite high RPM To be more correct the electric engines torque will change when the rpm changes but is it a flatter curve then for a combustion engine so in most/all RPM depending on the combustion engine a electric engine have more torque and therefore faster acceleration",

Smell is basically small particles of whatever it is you are smelling, entering your oral and nasal cavity (Taste plays a role in smell - meaning when you smell a fart you are kinda tasting it too..). These small particles then, enter into [olfactory bulb](_URL_0_), stimulate your neurons through the olfactory nerve. These then send signals to your brain which you interpret as a smell. The reason you may get a bigger whiff out of the milk jug is because you have a higher, purer concentration of whatever chemicals in the milk you are actually smelling. Whereas in your cereal, that smell is diluted by the sugary, wheaty smell of cornflakes. SOURCE: Dental education, numerous anatomy and physiology classes.",
