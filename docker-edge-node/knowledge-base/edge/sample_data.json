      "query": "What did steppe nomads do to children with Down Syndrome or similar diseases?",
      "response": "People in the ancient world generally frowned on any sort of physical disability even if it was injury from war. Exposure was a common practice not only for Spartans in the movie 300, but most ancient and many primitive societies. It's very likely that steppe nomads would have engaged in similar practices if children appeared physically disabled or deformed, as they did not have the resources to support extra people that, at least in their view, could not contribute like a \"normal\" man or woman.",
